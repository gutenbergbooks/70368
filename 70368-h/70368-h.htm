<p class="no-indent">No single factor is more important to the strength of our
democracy than the free flow of accurate information about
the government’s operations. The citizen in a democracy
must know what his government is doing, or he will lack
the soundest basis for judging the candidates and the platforms
of our political parties.</p>

<p>Our elected officials are given only a temporary grant of
power, and only a temporary custody of government property
and government records. Neither the President nor those
he appoints have any royal prerogative; they have only a
limited right to steer our government within the framework
of the Constitution and the laws.</p>

<p>It is well to remember that every withholding of government
business from the public is an encroachment upon the
democratic principle that government officials are accountable
to the people. It follows that citizens should regard all
governmental secrecy with some suspicion as an encroachment
on their right to know.</p>

<p>The American citizen should reject all arbitrary claims to
secrecy by the bureaucracy as sharply as he would reject
any claims to a right of the executive branch to by-pass Congress
in levying taxes. A wise citizen should be as outraged
at arbitrary secrecy as he would be at arbitrary imprisonment.
Logically he should insist on the same safeguards
against arbitrary secrecy that he would against unjustified<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
arrest or taxation. The public’s “right to know” is that basic.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, there is a general tendency to regard government
secrecy as only a problem for the newspapers. And
even within the newspaper profession there is a tendency to
ignore government secrecy until it interferes with a story
the individual reporter or editor wants to develop.</p>

<p>I am not interested in pleading for any special right of access
to government information for newspapers or reporters.
As vital as their function is, newspapers, magazines, television
and radio for the most part merely provide an orderly
process for disseminating information about government to
the people who do not have the time, money, or technical
facility to acquire the information for themselves. Transmitting
information gathered at a government press conference
or through a government press release does not necessarily
answer the people’s right to know.</p>

<p>The public has a right to expect that its government’s press
releases will be factually accurate, and for the most part
they are. We also have a right to expect our highest officials
to be factually accurate, but we must recognize realistically
that it is only normal for them to color facts with opinions
and conclusions that are most favorable to the political party
in power.</p>

<p>This manipulation, shading, twisting, or omission of facts—often
referred to as “managing the news”—will be limited
only by the political fear of being exposed for having made
erroneous or intentionally misleading statements to the public.
As reprehensible as the practice can be, it is nevertheless
a political fact of life and those who lament its existence
would do better to bolster the one sure safeguard against it:
the people’s right to know—through the press and through
their elected representatives in Congress. News management,
I repeat, can be controlled only by insisting on the
public’s right to go behind the statements distributed by the
government agencies or by high government officials.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span></p>

<p>Those who manipulate the news or try to cover their tracks
with arbitrary secrecy are not likely to be pursuing totalitarian
goals. Usually the only motivation is short-term political
gain. Often it is rationalized on grounds that a few factual
errors and overdrawn conclusions are not important when
viewed in the total context of the achievements of the party
in power. There is also the standard rationalization that a
few distortions only serve to balance the distortions of the
other political party.</p>

<p>No administration enjoys admitting errors or mismanagement
of government. Because the criticism is usually initiated
by the political opposition, it is often harsh and overdrawn.
An instinctive defensiveness springs up within the defending
political party, and the battle rages.</p>

<p>In the classic political controversy, the initial criticism has
been followed by a demand for a full investigation. The press
has already done some investigative work and has printed
stories dealing with all available aspects of the controversy.
However, when the probing by the press or by private citizens
has not been conclusive, the Congress, throughout the
history of the United States, has launched investigations to
dig out the facts not otherwise available to the press or the
public. And almost as often as the Congress has dug in, the
executive branch has refused or been reluctant to co-operate.</p>

<p>A truly thorough investigation of the executive branch can
be conducted only in the Congress. It is unreasonable to believe
that an Attorney General, appointed by the President,
will aggressively delve into an investigation of matters that
might embarrass his own administration. For this reason, the
right of the public and the press to government information
is for the most part contingent upon the power of Congress
to obtain documents and testimony from the executive
branch.</p>

<p>If the committees of Congress, acting within the scope of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
their authority, cannot obtain access to all the facts on government
activity, then the facts can be arbitrarily hidden for
the duration of the administration’s power. Who would argue
that any administration should be allowed to bury its
crimes, its mismanagement, and its errors until a public,
barred from full facts on these matters, decides to vote that
party from power? Such a philosophy would put a premium
on the Washington cover-up.</p>

<p>Properly authorized committees must have the power to
compel government officials to testify and produce government
records. If this power is lacking, the Congress, the press,
and the public are dependent upon the information or half-information
that the executive branch chooses to release. It
should be obvious to even a novice in politics that politicians
are not likely to voluntarily produce testimony or records
that may harm their own aspirations.</p>

<p>Most congressional requests for information have been
filled without trouble. The executive branch has resisted,
however, whenever it seemed likely that congressional hearings
would expose some political favorite or embarrass the
administration. Invariably it has been claimed that the Congress
was invading the executive branch and that some constitutional
issue was involved.</p>

<p>In this book I will show how the executive branch, beginning
with George Washington’s administration, has handled
requests from Congress for delivery of information. And I
will show how the tendency to withhold information has
grown, particularly since World War II.</p>

<p>It is not my intention to argue that all government information
should be made public immediately, for I am fully
aware of the need for security on military matters as well as
the need for some restrictions on release of information from
personnel files and investigative files.</p>

<p>In practice, we must allow our elected officials the right to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
withhold some kinds of information from the public. War
plans and other papers involving military security are the
more obvious examples. But any withholding should be done
under specific grants of authority from Congress or under
specific grants in the Constitution, and the authority should
be carefully limited. The broad right of arbitrary withholding
of information is not something that any officials
should be permitted to arrogate to themselves.</p>

<p>There is ample justification for laws that set out areas of
military information to be withheld from the general public.
There always has been. It would be especially foolhardy
in these days of serious international tension to insist on a
full public disclosure of our military posture. However, this
does not mean that all persons outside the military establishment
should be barred from access to military information.
There should be no question about proper committees of Congress
having access to nearly all information on military
spending, for this is the only way the Congress can obtain
sufficient information for passing laws and appropriating
money. Also, the auditors of the General Accounting Office
(GAO) must have access to all but the most highly classified
Defense secrets, or they will be unable to carry out their
duties of determining whether expenditures are being made
in an efficient and lawful manner.</p>

<p>There might also be justification for withholding information
from the public when it involves diplomatic negotiations
with a foreign nation. However, barring the public should
not bar the GAO or properly authorized committees of Congress
except under the most unusual and most clearly delineated
circumstances.</p>

<p>There are other areas of government in which secrecy is
justified. These include the raw investigative files of the Federal
Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and some parts of the
government personnel files. There are clear reasons for barring
the public from the FBI investigative files, for these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
files contain much unevaluated rumor and many unauthenticated
documents. Also, as FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover
has pointed out, much mischief could be done by the underworld
and subversive elements if they had access to FBI
files.</p>

<p>But while we are using a limited secrecy to guard our
chief federal investigative agency, we must realize that law
enforcement agencies can go wrong if there is not some regular
scrutiny from the outside. This was demonstrated in the
twenties, just prior to the time when J. Edgar Hoover
was put in charge of cleaning up the federal investigative
agency. We have been fortunate to have a J. Edgar Hoover
heading the FBI, but we cannot assume that the office will
always be filled by one whose major ambition is creating and
maintaining a skilled career investigative agency.</p>

<p>Under unusual circumstances, arrangements have been
made for examination of an entire FBI file by the chairmen
of the Judiciary committees of the House and Senate. On
occasion, the ranking minority member of these committees
has taken part. Since this procedure provides for examination
by a Democrat and a Republican, it has the strength of being
bipartisan. It has the disadvantage of depending on the
character and personality of the majority and minority representatives
for true bipartisanship. The procedure is a
touchy one that the press, the public, and the Congress must
scrutinize periodically. Certainly the FBI must have a right
to keep its files secret from the public, but it should never
be forgotten that some limited bipartisan congressional
group must have authority to examine these files if we are
to remain secure from possible abuse of power.</p>

<p>President Truman wrapped government personnel files in
secrecy on the theory that making them available to a Republican-dominated
committee of Congress could result in
the use of rumor and hearsay to “smear” government officials.
Certainly it is laudable to try to protect government employees<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
from baseless charges. But this “protection” for the government
employees has its drawbacks. Such secrecy has been
used to prevent government employees from gaining access
to their own medical records which were material to a defense
in an ouster action. It also shields government personnel
administrators from criticism and thereby encourages
arbitrary actions.</p>

<p>I learned once of a case in which the secrecy surrounding
personnel files made it impossible for a woman to find out
why she had been discharged by the government. I will refer
to the woman as Mrs. A, for there is no necessity of stirring
up more problems for her now if she has been able to find a
job after being out of work for several years.</p>

<p>Mrs. A was a woman of about fifty with more than twenty
years of service with the Civil Service Commission as a
shorthand reporter. She had had some problems with an employee
in the same section and some disagreement with a
supervisor. She was asked to go to the Department of Health,
Education and Welfare for a physical examination.</p>

<p>Mrs. A took the physical examination and shortly afterwards
was forced to resign. She was given no reason except
that something in the physical examination made her unqualified
to continue as a government employee. Mrs. A
went to a private physician and had a thorough examination
to try to find out why she was unqualified to hold her job
with the government. The doctor could find no reason for her
discharge.</p>

<p>At this point Mrs. A hired a lawyer. Neither the doctor nor
the lawyer could obtain access to the records of the physical
examination given to Mrs. A at the Department of Health,
Education and Welfare. The lawyer hired by Mrs. A found
himself tilting with a ghost. He could not find out why his
client was discharged, and yet he was faced with trying to
establish proof that whatever was alleged was not true.</p>

<p>I could not believe the story Mrs. A told when she first<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
came to my office, but I said I would examine it and see what
I could do. It checked out in every detail. I was informed at
the Health, Education and Welfare Department that the
physical records of all government employees were confidential.
There were no exceptions. I pointed out that this confidential
status was set up for the purpose of protecting the
government employees against public intrusion, but that it
certainly couldn’t be meant to keep a government employee
or her private doctor from examining her records. Officials at
the Department of Health, Education and Welfare disagreed.
I made repeated calls to see if I could get the policy
changed, but to no avail.</p>

<p>Mrs. A was a little more distressed each time she came by
the office, for I was unable to interest anyone in her case.
She was not important. She was not the center of a big political
drama.</p>

<p>Was it a wrongful discharge? I could not answer the question
when it was raised by lawyers for committees of Congress.
It was possible the file would have shown justifiable
grounds for the discharge. I could only argue that it was
wrong to bar this woman, her lawyer, and her doctor from
examination of a file giving the results of her government
health examination.</p>

<p>Despite the inequity in this case and others similar to it, a
general belief prevailed in Washington that secrecy on government
personnel files and loyalty-security files was an unmixed
blessing. The fallacy of this contention was impressed
on me every time I saw Mrs. A. She was defeated in appearance,
and she was deeply hurt.</p>

<p>There is a sharp cruelty in secrecy that results in such injury
to an individual, and there is great damage to our government—and
to people’s faith in it—when secrecy is used to
cover up mismanagement and corruption. I am gravely concerned
over any obstructions put in the way of congressional
committees’ investigating the abuses of secrecy. Where<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
would we be if Congress had not looked into such nefarious
schemes as the Teapot Dome scandals of the Harding administration
or the tax “fixes” in the Truman administration?</p>

<p>Have we, a self-governing people, learned anything from
these black marks on our history? I am afraid that we have
not learned enough yet. I am afraid that the people as a
whole, and many persons in the press and Congress, tend
to disregard the danger signs and accept the self-serving declarations
of virtue from their Presidents or other high officials.
A few newspapers, a few diligent investigators for congressional
committees, a few senators and a few congressmen
have had to take the whole responsibility for breaking
through unjustified secrecy and uncovering the truth.</p>

<p>In my twenty years as a newspaper correspondent I have
been concerned with this problem of information policies at
every level of government—starting in a local police station,
city hall, county courthouse, and state capitol. For the past
eleven years I have been covering the federal government
for the Washington Bureau of Cowles Publications. I have
been fortunate to have the freedom to follow any investigations
that interested me, as well as the enthusiastic support
of several newspapers. My position has afforded me the privilege
of a day-to-day acquaintanceship with every major investigation
in Washington since 1950.</p>

<p>The problem of the Washington cover-up became a major
interest to me in connection with the scandals in the Reconstruction
Finance Corporation (RFC) and the Internal Revenue
Service beginning in 1950. The investigations of the
RFC were of a reasonably short duration. The pattern of
“political favoritism” in administering this government loaning
agency was ended when W. Stuart Symington, later a
United States Senator, was named by President Truman to
restore order. Symington instituted the “fishbowl policy” that
brought most of the RFC operations out in the open.</p>

<p>The problems with secrecy in the Internal Revenue Service<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
remained a major news story for more than two years.
The Internal Revenue law provides that it is unlawful to disclose
the information on the tax returns submitted by U.S.
taxpayers. It was a secrecy established in a specific statute,
and the purpose was to protect the privacy of the finances of
individual taxpayers. However, investigations by Senator
John J. Williams, the Delaware Republican, and a House
subcommittee, headed by Representative Cecil King, the
California Democrat, showed that the secrecy was used to
shield crooked tax agents and tax collectors from exposure
and prosecution.</p>

<p>The Alcohol Tax Unit (ATU), a division of the Internal
Revenue Service, had even set up procedures to provide for
secret settlements of criminal law violations. Also, ATU provided
secret hearings on applications for a federal license to
wholesale liquor or beer. A racketeer found it possible to
go into a secret hearing, give perjured testimony, and obtain
a license with the help of weak or corrupt ATU administrators.</p>

<p>The lesson was clear in each case: secrecy corrupts. It allowed
government officials to dispense favors behind closed
doors. When decisions were secret, there was no need to provide
any consistency in decisions or in penalties. It was
impossible for the public or the press to obtain enough information
to register an informed objection.</p>

<p>During fights to open records in the Internal Revenue
Service, I became acquainted with James S. Pope, executive
editor of the Louisville <cite>Courier-Journal</cite> who was then chairman
of the Freedom of Information Committee of the American
Society of Newspaper Editors. We worked together in
forcing the Internal Revenue Service to open certain “compromise
settlements” of tax cases as well as the ATU hearings.</p>

<p>In exploring these and other information problems, I
worked closely with the late Harold Cross, former special<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
counsel for the American Society of Newspaper Editors; J.
Russell Wiggins, executive editor of the Washington <cite>Post and
Times Herald</cite>; Herbert Brucker, editor of the Hartford <cite>Courant</cite>;
and V. M. (Red) Newton, managing editor of the
Tampa <cite>Tribune</cite>.</p>

<p>We shared a deep suspicion of government secrecy and
also resented what it did in corrupting our system of government.
I was privileged to serve as a member of the national
Freedom of Information Committee of Sigma Delta
Chi (the journalism fraternity) and handle the Washington
phase of the reports for Red Newton for a period of more
than five years. For a longer period I have worked with the
American Society of Newspaper Editors’ Freedom of Information
Committee. I have testified before committees of the
House and Senate.</p>

<p>My testimony before the Moss subcommittee in November
1955 was the first testimony on the scope of the problem of
“executive privilege” advanced by the Eisenhower administration.
I have kept in touch continuously with Representative
John Moss, the California Democrat, and the members of
his staff from the time their subcommittee was established. I
am particularly indebted to Staff Administrator Sam Archibald,
Staff Consultant Paul Southwick, and staff lawyers John
Mitchell and the late Jacob Scher.</p>

<p>Others who were particularly helpful and co-operative
over these years were the late Senator Thomas Hennings
(Dem., Mo.); Charles Slayman, counsel for the Hennings
Judiciary Subcommittee; Senator John McClellan (Dem.,
Ark.), and Robert F. Kennedy, who was his chief counsel;
Herbert Maletz, chief counsel for a House Judiciary Subcommittee;
Representative Porter Hardy (Dem., Va.); John
Reddan, chief counsel for the Hardy Government Operations
Subcommittee; Representative F. Edward Hebert (Dem.,
La.); James Naughton, chief counsel for the Fountain Government
Operations Subcommittee; and John Courtney,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
chief counsel for the Hebert Armed Services Subcommittee;
Arthur John Keefe, counsel for the Senate Antitrust and Monopoly
Subcommittee; and Representative George Meader
(Rep., Mich.).</p>

<p>The knowledge of the secrecy problem gained by most of
these lawmakers and lawyers has been understandably confined
to their experiences with one or two committees,
whereas I have had the opportunity to become aware of the
day-to-day activities of nearly all the committees. For that
reason, and because of my alarm at the public apathy over
government secrecy, I have decided to set the whole story
down in one place. Most of the story is taken from the official
records of congressional committees—the sworn testimony,
the correspondence with government agencies, and the official
reports of Senate and House investigators. As much as
possible, I have put it together in chronological, narrative
form so that the reader may discover, as I did, how the abuse
of government secrecy has spread and just how vast and serious
the scope of it has become. At the end of the book I will
make some recommendations that I hope may serve as a
guide to eliminating this serious threat to our democratic
form of government.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II<br>
<span class="fs150">The First Century</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">An Indian uprising along the Indiana-Ohio border in 1791
set the stage for the first investigation by Congress of decisions
in the executive branch. President Washington, then
in his first term, sent Major General Arthur St. Clair into the
wilderness to put a stop to the raids.</p>

<p>General St. Clair and his fourteen hundred American soldiers
were camped along the headwaters of the Wabash
River on November 3 when they were surprised by the attack
of a strong force led by Little Turtle, chief of the
Miami.</p>

<p>The Indians killed more than six hundred officers and men
and forced the others to retreat. It was a humiliating defeat,
one that still ranks among the worst in our history. Congress
demanded an explanation.</p>

<p>On March 27, 1792, the House of Representatives appointed
a select committee to inquire into the failure of the
St. Clair expedition, and “to call for such persons, papers,
and records, as may be necessary to assist their inquiries.”
For the first time, the President and his Cabinet were presented
with the problem of whether to make papers and
testimony available to Congress.</p>

<p>President Washington called a meeting of his full Cabinet
to determine the proper way to proceed, for he was aware
that the action taken would set a precedent on such matters.</p>

<p>Thomas Jefferson wrote the following account of the meeting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
and the conclusions drawn by the Washington Cabinet:</p>

<p>“First, that the House was an inquest, and therefore might
institute inquiries. Second, that it might call for papers generally.
Third, that the Executive ought to communicate such
papers as the public good would permit, and ought to refuse
those, the disclosure of which would injure the public; consequently
were to exercise a discretion. Fourth, that neither
the committee nor House had a right to call on the head of
a department, who and whose papers were under the President
alone; but that the committee should instruct their
chairman to move the House to address the President.”</p>

<p>Jefferson also wrote:</p>

<p>“Hamilton agreed with us in all these points except as to
the power of the House to call on the heads of departments.
He observed that as to his department, the act constituting it
had made it subject to Congress in some points, but he
thought himself not so far subject as to be obliged to produce
all the papers they might call for. They might demand secrets
of a very mischievous nature. (Here I thought he began
to fear they would go on to examining how far their
own members and other persons in the government had been
dabbling in stocks, banks, etc., and that he probably would
choose in this case to deny their power; and in short, he
endeavored to place himself subject to the House, when the
Executive should propose what he did not like, and subject to
the Executive when the House should propose anything disagreeable.)...
Finally agreed, to speak separately to the
members of the committee, and bring them by persuasion
into the right channel. It was agreed in this case, that there
was not a paper which might not be properly produced; that
if they should desire it, a clerk should attend with the originals
to be verified by themselves.”</p>

<p>Although the Cabinet indicated a need for a discretion to
withhold papers “which would injure the public,” President
Washington agreed that in the case of the St. Clair expedition<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
“there was not a paper which might not be produced.”</p>

<p>There was no withholding by President Washington in
this case, and it could hardly be regarded seriously as a precedent
for any right to arbitrarily refuse executive papers to
Congress.</p>

<p>There was one other instance in Washington’s administration
in which the Congress asked for executive papers. In
this case, the House of Representatives asked for the papers
and instructions to United States ambassadors who negotiated
the Jay treaty. This time Washington refused to deliver
the papers to the House on the specific constitutional grounds
that the Senate, not the House, is authorized to advise and
consent on treaty matters.</p>

<p>A Supreme Court case in the administration of President
Thomas Jefferson raised the question of whether it was possible
for the courts to force the Cabinet to perform certain
acts required by law. In the last hours of the administration
of President John Adams a “midnight appointment” was
made of a justice of the peace for the District of Columbia
named William Marbury, a minor Federalist political figure.
James Madison, who became the new Secretary of State in
the Jefferson administration, refused to deliver the commission
to Marbury to complete the appointment process.</p>

<p>Marbury asked the Supreme Court to issue a writ of mandamus
under the Judiciary Act of 1789 to force Madison to
deliver the commission. In February 1803, Chief Justice
John Marshall delivered the opinion of the court. First he
dealt with the question of whether Madison had a right to
refuse to deliver the commission to a properly appointed
official. The decision was a rebuke to Secretary of State Madison
and stated: “Is it to be contended that the heads of departments
are not amenable to the laws of their country?”</p>

<p>However, the opinion went on to conclude that the Constitution
provided no method for the Supreme Court to issue
writs to force the executive action requested. Chief Justice<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
Marshall stated that the Judiciary Act providing for a writ
was inconsistent with the Constitution, and that “a law repugnant
to the Constitution is void.”</p>

<p>Although Madison was wrong in withholding the commission
from Marbury, the court held that under the Constitution
there was no way to force action. The case did not mean
that Madison had a legal right, but only that Marbury had
no remedy. The Marbury appointment was in essence a political
matter and could only have been countered indirectly
by the impeachment of the President.</p>

<p>The specific question of congressional access to executive
papers was raised in one case in the Jefferson administration.
In 1807, President Jefferson was requested to furnish the
House “any information in the possession of the Executive”
on the allegation of a conspiracy by Aaron Burr. However,
the request specifically exempted papers “such as he [Jefferson]
may deem the public welfare to require not to be disclosed.”</p>

<p>President Jefferson displayed an awareness of the dangers
of arbitrary withholding of information by carefully explaining
the nature of the papers he did not deliver. He stated
that these papers included matters “chiefly in the form of
letters, often containing such a mixture of rumors, conjectures,
and suspicions as to render it difficult to sift out the real
facts and unadvisable to hazard more than general outlines,
strengthened by concurrent information or the particular
credibility of the relator.”</p>

<p>Later, when Aaron Burr was actually tried for treason in
Richmond, Chief Justice Marshall issued a subpoena for papers
in Jefferson’s custody, including a private letter from
General James Wilkinson to Jefferson. While Jefferson continued
to assert a right to determine which papers he would
produce, he did in fact send all the documents requested in
the subpoena. Also, General Wilkinson appeared at the trial
and testified fully about his communications with President<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
Jefferson. Chief Justice Marshall’s decision conceded that the
President could not be summoned to make a personal appearance
before a judicial body because of the nature of his
position and the dignity of his office. Since Jefferson produced
all the documents under subpoena there was no need for adjudicating
the issue of what types of papers might be withheld.
[The trial eventually resulted in a jury acquittal for
Burr.]</p>

<p>Until President Jackson’s term there were no significant
controversies over requests for information. Jackson was involved
in a number of disputes. Although he consistently asserted
a right to withhold information from Congress, he
usually sent the requested documents along with his angry
criticism of Congress for making the requests.</p>

<p>A Senate investigation of land frauds in the Jackson administration
resulted in demands for papers dealing with
land transactions conducted by a Jackson appointee. President
Jackson refused to deliver the papers to Congress, but
the resulting cover-up of land frauds could hardly be called
a precedent worthy to be followed.</p>

<p>President John Tyler was requested to submit to the House
of Representatives the reports of Lieutenant Colonel Ethan
Allen Hitchcock concerning an investigation of frauds
which were alleged to have been perpetrated on the Cherokee
Indians. President Tyler produced a part of the information
at the time of the request but declined to produce the
full investigative reports in 1843. He argued that to be effective
such investigations must often be confidential.</p>

<p>“They may result in the collection of truth or falsehood;
or they may be incomplete, and may require further prosecution,”
Tyler said. “To maintain that the President can
exercise no discretion ... would deprive him at once of the
means of performing one of the most salutary duties of his
office ... and would render him dependent upon ... [another]<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
branch [of government] in the performance of a duty
purely executive.”</p>

<p>However, in a later message to Congress on the Cherokee
Indians matter, President Tyler directed that all of the reports
be made available. He did not acknowledge the right
of Congress to command the Executive to produce all information.
Neither did he claim an unlimited right for the
President to withhold. He declared that there must be some
discretion left with the President when “the interests of the
country or of individuals” is to be affected by production of
the records. He enumerated some circumstances in which
he felt the President actually had a duty to withhold—as, for
example, during a pending law enforcement investigation.</p>

<p>After the Civil War there was a flurry of investigations,
but these caused little conflict. The corrupters in the Grant
administration were foresighted enough to bring key members
of the Republican Congress into their dishonest schemes
as an insurance against exposure by the committees of
Congress.</p>

<p>A Democratic Congress, elected in 1874, initiated a series
of investigations into the War and Treasury Departments
to eradicate the corruption and to set the stage for the next
presidential campaign in 1876. The frauds were so raw that
the feeble efforts to hide them were useless. The inquiries
disclosed how the government was defrauded by a “Whisky
Ring” that evaded millions of dollars in taxes on distilled
whisky. The “ring” operated with co-operation from some
Treasury officials as well as from President Grant’s private
secretary, General Orville E. Babcock.</p>

<p>Another congressional investigation of the Grant administration
implicated Secretary of War W. W. Belknap in
widespread graft in the assignment of trading posts in the
Indian territory. He resigned from office in the face of a
threat of impeachment, carrying with him a presidential
letter expressing “regret” that he was leaving government.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
President Grant’s letter of “regret” to a man who had betrayed
a trust set a pattern for Presidents for a long time to
come. The whole ritual, indeed, has remained the same. First
come the accusations, followed by denials of any improprieties.
Then comes the effort to hide the records. This is
followed by the tardy admission of facts but a denial of
illegality, and finally the letter from the President lauding
the dishonest public official for his fine service coupled with
“regretful” acceptance of his resignation.</p>

<p>The corruption of the Grant administration is considered
by many to be the worst blot on the nation’s escutcheon.
Republican political figures organized a
<ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;original text: constuction">construction</ins> firm,
the Crédit Mobilier of America, which was used to divert
lavish profits from the building of the Union Pacific Railway.
An American diplomatic figure lent his name to a huge mine
swindle, Navy contracts were for sale, and there were wholesale
frauds in the custom houses.</p>

<p>The widespread scandals of the Grant administration presented
no basic problem for Congress in obtaining government
records because the key evidence in these cases could
be obtained from sources outside the executive branch.</p>

<p>However, a problem did develop in 1876 when the Democratic
House sought to obtain testimony and records of
financial transactions of Jay Cooke &amp; Company. Jay Cooke
&amp; Company was one of the largest financial institutions of
the time, and Jay Cooke was close to the Grant administration
and Republican party politics. When the House of
Representatives discovered that the Secretary of the Treasury
had deposited large sums of money with a London branch
of Jay Cooke &amp; Company, it sought to determine whether
there was some impropriety involved in the decision to make
the deposit.</p>

<p>In the course of its investigation, the House issued a subpoena
for Hallet Kilbourn, who managed some real estate
operations for Jay Cooke &amp; Company. Kilbourn refused to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
produce the documents sought and argued that the House
had no right to investigate private affairs. The House ordered
him arrested for contempt.</p>

<p>Kilbourn was imprisoned by House Sergeant at Arms John
Thompson. Kilbourn immediately obtained a court order for
his release and then sued Thompson for false imprisonment.
The U. S. Supreme Court held that Thompson was liable for
damages, and in the decision threw a doubt over the right of
Congress to punish witnesses for refusing to answer questions
or produce records.</p>

<p>The decision upset the long-standing view that the power
of Congress to investigate was as broad as the almost limitless
power of inquiry of the British Parliament. The U. S.
Supreme Court stated:</p>

<p>“We are sure no person can be punished for contumacy as
a witness of either House, unless his testimony is required in
a matter into which that House has jurisdiction to inquire,
and we feel equally sure that neither of these bodies possess
the general power of making inquiry into private affairs of
the citizen.”</p>

<p>It was not until 1927, when the U. S. Supreme Court
decided the case of <em>McGrain v. Daugherty</em>, that the right
of Congress to compel testimony was firmly reaffirmed. In
the intervening thirty-five years two Presidents successfully
resisted the Congress!</p>

<p>President Grover Cleveland, a Democrat, faced a Republican
Senate, and Theodore Roosevelt, an independent-minded
Republican, took delight in testing his strength even
against a Republican Congress.</p>

<p>President Cleveland in 1886 backed his Attorney General
in refusing to deliver to the Senate some reports dealing with
the administration of the United States District Attorney’s
office in the District of Columbia. The man who had held
the office had been suspended, and Cleveland argued that
the report on the reasons was the business of the executive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
branch. Because the Kilbourn case had weakened the position
of Congress, Cleveland was not challenged.</p>

<p>President Theodore Roosevelt refused to allow his Attorney
General to deliver papers to the Senate dealing with
the status of investigations involving the U.S. Steel Corporation.
The papers included an Attorney General’s opinion on
the U.S. Steel Corporation case.</p>

<p>Although the papers sought involved a pending case, the
Senate insisted on pursuing the matter. Herbert K. Smith,
head of the Bureau of Corporations, was summoned and was
threatened with contempt and imprisonment if he failed to
produce the documents. President Roosevelt asked Smith for
the papers and, after taking them into his possession, informed
the Senate the only way they could get the papers
would be by impeaching him. The Senate then dropped the
matter.</p>

<p>The infamous scandals of the Harding administration renewed
the will of the Congress, and proved for all time
the need for Congress to investigate even when a President
assures the public that “all is well.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III<br>
<span class="fs150">Teapot Dome to the Tax Scandals</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">Before Congress completed its investigations of the Harding
administration scandals, cabinet officers had been found to
be involved in the maladministration or corruption. Secretary
of Navy Edwin Denby resigned from office under a
barrage of criticism. Attorney General Harry M. Daugherty,
involved in several questionable financial transactions, was
indicted on a charge of having accepted a $200,000 payoff in
connection with handling of Alien Property Custodian affairs.
Daugherty was acquitted of the criminal charge, but
reports of Congress established him as corrupt and incompetent
in the handling of his office. Secretary of Interior
Albert Fall was convicted of accepting a bribe and sent to
prison.</p>

<p>It was in May 1921, within a year of President Harding’s
election, that Secretary of Interior Fall persuaded the President
and Navy Secretary Denby to transfer certain naval oil
reserves from the Navy to the Interior Department. Once he
got them within his domain, Fall then transferred the oil
reserves—at Teapot Dome, Wyoming, and Elk Hills, California—to
two private oil producers, Harry Sinclair and E.
L. Doheny. The leases were signed secretly, without competitive
bidding, and Secretary of Interior Fall conveniently
tossed them into a drawer away from public view. He then
proceeded to collect $100,000 from Doheny for the Elk Hills<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
transfer, and $300,000 from Sinclair for the Teapot Dome
transfer.</p>

<p>Months later when the Democrats learned of the oil leases
they demanded explanations and alleged, without substantiation,
that the leases might involve some improprieties. Fall
and Denby explained that the transfers to the Interior Department
and the leasings were “in the public interest.”</p>

<p>When President Harding put his personal stamp of approval
on the leasing of the oil reserves, public sentiment
turned against the investigating Democrats. A big, smiling
man with an open face that seemed to project total integrity,
Harding easily gave the impression that all was well with
the oil reserve transactions. Although events later proved that
he lacked understanding of the Teapot Dome scandals as
well as many other important matters that took place in
his administration, his reassurances at this stage were readily
accepted by the public and the press.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the Senate investigating committee persisted.
Both Secretary of Interior Fall and Secretary of Navy
Denby were called to testify. It was essential to question
these two high-level government officials to lay the groundwork
for the investigation. It was essential to explore the
conversations between them, as well as the personal financial
transactions between Fall and the Doheny and Sinclair interests.
It was also necessary to explore the opinions and
recommendations of subordinate officials.</p>

<p>Without all of this information, Congress could not have
proved the dishonest use of a government position by Albert
Fall. It would have been naïve to expect that the Justice
Department under Harry Daugherty would have conducted
an investigation that was fair and objective, for Daugherty
was already mired in his own corruption.</p>

<p>The Harding scandals should have demonstrated for all
time that the public cannot rely on any administration to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
police itself. Nor can it rely on the self-serving declarations
of a President, however well-meaning he may be.</p>

<p>President Harding died on August 2, 1923, a broken and
disillusioned man, still unaware, however, of the full extent
of the scandals. Coolidge’s administration and most of
Hoover’s had passed before the investigations were finally
completed, the convictions recorded, the appeals completed,
and Fall imprisoned in 1931.</p>

<p>President Coolidge was faced with a request for a list of
the companies in which his Secretary of Treasury, Andrew
Mellon, had an interest. A special Senate investigating committee
was studying the Bureau of Internal Revenue and
wanted to investigate the tax returns of firms with which
Mellon was associated.</p>

<p>President Coolidge said it would be “detrimental to the
public service” to reveal the list of Mellon’s business interests
and the tax returns of those firms. With that, the investigation
ended.</p>

<p>Another request for information was similarly nipped by
Hoover. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee had requested
that Secretary of State Henry L. Stimson produce
the contents of telegrams and letters leading up to the London
Conference and the London Treaty. The committee contended
it had a special right to such papers because of the
constitutional prerogative of the Senate in the treaty-making
process. Stimson disagreed and President Hoover backed
him, arguing that in order to maintain friendly relations with
other nations, it would be unwise to give the Senate all of
the information on statements leading up to the treaty.</p>

<p>President Franklin D. Roosevelt was favored with a Congress
that was largely on his side in his first two terms, so
that there were no conflicts over information sought by Congress.
Indeed, President Roosevelt preferred having committees
of Congress investigate and dramatize problems in
order to facilitate the passage of various New Deal measures.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span></p>

<p>Congress did run into opposition to requests for information
in Roosevelt’s third term, however. In 1941 Roosevelt
rejected requests for FBI records and reports, and in 1944
FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover refused to testify or to give
Congress a copy of a presidential directive requiring him,
in the interests of national security, to refrain from testifying.</p>

<p>The President was backed by a ruling from his Attorney
General, Francis Biddle. In a letter dated January 22, 1944,
Biddle claimed that communications between the President
and the heads of departments were confidential and privileged
and not subject to inquiry by Congress. Another opinion
by the Attorney General had previously supported
President Roosevelt in refusing to make records of the
Bureau of the Budget available to Congress.</p>

<p>The Roosevelt administration also used the secrecy routine
to hamper a House investigation of the Federal Communications
Commission (FCC) in 1943 and 1944. The FCC
probe involved the basic charge of political tampering with
an independent regulatory agency. There were indications of
improper secret contacts with some commission members
while cases were being decided.</p>

<p>The Roosevelt administration used every political method
available to impede the investigations, including the use of
friends in Congress to harass the investigators. Two men who
successively held the title of general counsel—Eugene L.
Garey and John J. Sirica—resigned in the face of the obstructions
and harassment. They charged the investigation was
being turned into a “whitewash.”</p>

<p>The final report of the committee gave the FCC a clean
bill of health. However, the minority report filed by Representative
Richard B. Wigglesworth, Republican of Massachusetts,
stated: “It has been impossible for the committee
to conduct anything approaching a thoroughgoing investigation.”</p>

<p>Congressman Wigglesworth charged that the committee<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
consistently acted “to suppress indefinitely alleged unsavory
facts said to involve high administration officials and advisers.”
He made reference to the “methods both brutal and
shameful” used to force the original chairman of the investigating
committee to resign, and to the general atmosphere
that resulted in the resignations of counsels Garey and
Sirica.</p>

<p>The unhealthy conditions, which the House committee
had started to expose, were left to fester, and fourteen years
later the full effects burst on the American public. The
investigations of the House Legislative Oversight Subcommittee
in 1957, 1958, and 1959, which will be described in
a later chapter, disclosed that the successful blocking of the
FCC investigation in 1944 not only allowed bad practices
to continue but thereby encouraged corruption.</p>

<p>Though President Roosevelt had directed the Secretaries
of War and Navy not to deliver some documents which the
FCC investigators had requested, his stated reason was
simply that it would “not be in the public interest.” No
broad claims of a constitutional right to withhold information
were ever invoked. There was no need for them because
the cover-up was that ruthless and that effective. Had the
nation not been at war, such a cover-up would likely have
caused a major uproar.</p>

<p>The end of World War II and the election of a Republican
Congress in 1946, however, brought the Democrats to
heel. From the time the Republican Congress took control
of the committees, the Truman administration was in almost
constant combat with Congress. The first disputes involved
the efforts of Republican committees of Congress to obtain
access to FBI records and loyalty files. Later disputes centered
on efforts to gain access to records of the Bureau of
Internal Revenue and the Justice Department.</p>

<p>In 1947, the Republicans were intent on demonstrating
that the Truman administration was “coddling Communists.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
Investigators sought access to personnel records and letters
dealing with the retention and promotion of persons who
were alleged to be security risks or of questionable loyalty.</p>

<p>President Truman issued an executive order barring Congress
from access to any of the loyalty or security information
in the personnel files of the government. He said it was
to protect the government employees from abuse by committees
of Congress. The unrestrained activities of some congressional
investigators did indeed make the order seem
justifiable to many. However, the Republicans viewed it as
a cover-up.</p>

<p>Representative Richard M. Nixon, later the Vice President,
Representative Charles Halleck, later the Republican
leader, and a dozen other prominent Republicans kept a
continuous barrage of criticism firing at President Truman.</p>

<p>Said Representative Nixon on April 22, 1948:</p>

<p>“I say that this proposition cannot stand from a constitutional
standpoint or on the basis of the merits for this
very good reason: They would mean the President could
have arbitrarily issued an Executive order in the [Bennett]
Meyers case, the Teapot Dome case, or any other case denying
the Congress of the United States information it needed
to conduct an investigation of the Executive department and
the Congress would have no right to question his decision.”</p>

<p>Again, three years later, Representative Halleck was saying
on the House floor:</p>

<p>“His [Truman’s] censorship order gives every agency
and department of the Government the absolute power to
decide what information shall be kept from them. These
agency heads are absolute czars unto themselves. When they
order the iron curtain down it stays down—a gag on the
press and radio of the nation.”</p>

<p>Most of this initial criticism was aimed at the rather
limited presidential order which barred Congress from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
government personnel files in the investigations of loyalty
and security cases.</p>

<p>Although the Truman administration was reluctant to
make records available when the Republicans began looking
into allegations of improper activities and political favoritism
in the Reconstruction Finance Corporation (RFC), in
the Bureau of Internal Revenue, and in the Justice Department,
no blanket order was issued refusing testimony or
records. The allegations were followed first by denials.
Then there was stalling but finally, under the pressure of
public opinion, the records were made available.</p>

<p>What happened specifically was this: Senator John J.
Williams, the Delaware Republican, produced some fairly
well documented cases of favoritism and bungling in the
nation’s number one tax agency. President Truman, Secretary
of Treasury John Snyder, and Attorney General J. Howard
McGrath all denied there was any widespread laxity or
corruption in the administration of the federal tax laws.
Daniel Bolich, the Assistant Commissioner of Internal Revenue,
and T. Lamar Caudle, the Assistant Attorney General
in charge of the Tax Division, went before the investigating
committees and assured the leaders of Congress that all was
well.</p>

<p>The self-serving declarations of the Truman administration
did not satisfy Senator Williams, however, for they were
inconsistent with many documented facts he held in his
possession. A subcommittee of the House Ways and Means
Committee was then established to conduct a deeper investigation
into the handling of tax cases in the Bureau of
Internal Revenue. Later a subcommittee of the House Judiciary
Committee was organized to conduct some further
examination of the way the Justice Department handled tax
cases as well as other matters.</p>

<p>Because tax cases were handled by the Bureau of Internal
Revenue, a branch of the Treasury Department, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
prosecuted by the Justice Department, both departments
were involved in the investigation. Tax cases, it was learned,
could be fixed in their initial stages by Internal Revenue
agents, or they could be sidetracked at higher levels in the
Bureau of Internal Revenue; they could be rejected for
prosecution by the Justice Department in Washington, or
kicked aside by the United States District Attorney. There
were at least a half-dozen points where a “fix” could take
place, and congressional investigations disclosed that some
cases were manipulated at almost all stages.</p>

<p>When at first the Justice Department files were not made
available, the stalling was recognized for what it was—an
effort to hide records that might be embarrassing. Newspapers
quickly pointed out the cover-up, and Acting Attorney
General Philip B. Perlman was forced to lay down
procedural rules for the committees of Congress to use in
requesting access to Justice Department files.</p>

<p>Perlman stated that the Justice Department would not
give Congress access to open cases, but that closed files would
be made available. He also said that FBI reports and similar
confidential information would not be made available. The
closed files and the testimony of high officials were nevertheless
sufficient to enable Congress to document the record of
the mishandling of federal tax investigations and prosecution.
Congress extracted testimony from two cabinet officials—Attorney
General J. Howard McGrath and Secretary
of Treasury John Snyder. They revealed their conversations
and communications with their highest subordinates. Records
were produced showing the advice, recommendations, and
conclusions of investigators in the Internal Revenue Service
and the staff lawyers in the Justice Department. It was clear
that some of the cases had not been handled in the normal
manner, and that recommendations from subordinate officials
were disregarded at some key points.</p>

<p>Only through this full examination was it possible to prove<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
that some cases were being “fixed” for money or for political
considerations. Without the full record on the recommendations
from lower officials it would have been impossible to
prove that the mismanagement was due to anything more
than “poor judgment” or negligence.</p>

<p>Neither Attorney General McGrath nor Treasury Secretary
Snyder was shown to be involved in illegal tampering
with any tax cases. However, they had contended that the
initial allegations of fraud and mismanagement were untrue.</p>

<p>The investigations by Congress proved that several high
officials were involved in outright fraud, and a good many
more were involved in gross negligence. The Commissioner
of Internal Revenue, the Assistant Commissioner, and the
chief counsel for the Bureau of Internal Revenue all resigned
under fire.</p>

<p>A former Commissioner of Internal Revenue, Joseph
Nunan, was subsequently indicted and convicted on charges
of failing to report large amounts of unexplained income.
Assistant Commissioner Daniel Bolich was indicted and convicted
on charges of failing to report more than $200,000 in
income, though the conviction was later upset by the United
States Supreme Court on technical grounds. T. Lamar
Caudle, former Assistant Attorney General, in charge of the
Tax Division, was indicted, convicted, and sent to prison on a
criminal charge arising out of his mishandling of a federal
income tax case. Convicted with Caudle was Matthew Connelly,
appointment secretary for President Truman.</p>

<p>In total, dozens of tax officials were ousted from office for
questionable handling of tax cases, and dozens were indicted
and convicted on charges of cheating on their own tax returns.
The mismanagement and fraud, which the Truman
administration had sought to deny existed, was more widespread
and sordid than most of the critics of the Bureau of
Internal Revenue had imagined. The damage to the integrity
of the nation’s tax system was incalculable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span></p>

<p>If ever a scandal were needed to prove the necessity of a
congressional review to keep our big federal agencies open
and clean, the Truman tax scandal was it. The success of
their investigations only goaded the Republicans to further
probing and policing. In their party platform of 1952, the
Republicans pledged “to put an end to corruption, to oust
the crooks and grafters, to administer tax laws fairly and
impartially, and to restore honest government to the people.”</p>

<p>When he accepted the party’s nomination in Chicago on
July 11, 1952, General Dwight D. Eisenhower said:</p>

<p>“Our aims—the aim of this Republican crusade—are clear:
to sweep from office an Administration which has fastened
on every one of us the wastefulness, the arrogance and corruption
in high places, the heavy burdens and the anxieties
which are the bitter fruit of a party too long in power.”</p>

<p>“What the Washington mess must have is the full treatment,”
Candidate Eisenhower declared at Atlanta, Ga., on
September 2, 1952. “The only clean-up that will do the job
is the wholesale cleanout of the political bosses in Washington.
I pledge you that ... I shall not rest until the peddlers
of privilege and the destroyers of decency are banished from
the nation’s house.”</p>

<p>Two days later at Philadelphia, he spoke of the need for
an open, frank government:</p>

<p>“We must not minimize the difficulties; neither can we
seek with words and dollars to make the going look easy
when it is tough. There will be mistakes, but the mistakes
we make will not be doctored up to look like triumphs. There
will be no curtain of evasion, of suppression, or double talk
between ourselves and the people.”</p>

<p>At Des Moines, Iowa, on September 18: “We are going to
cast out the crooks and their cronies.... And when it comes
to casting out the crooks and their cronies, I can promise
you that we won’t wait for congressional prodding and investigations.
The prodding this time will start from the top.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
And when we are through, the experts in shady and shoddy
government operations will be on their way back to the
shadowy haunts, the sub-cellars of American politics from
whence they came.... The first thing we have to do is get
a government that is honest....”</p>

<p>And at St. Louis, Mo.:</p>

<p>“... we must take the people, themselves, into our confidence
and thereby, restore their confidence in government.
We will keep the people informed because an informed
people is the keystone in the arch of free government.”</p>

<p>The crusade against secrecy and corruption stayed at the
forefront of the campaign and swept Eisenhower and Nixon
into office on November 4. When the electoral vote was
tallied, it stood 422 Republicans to 89 Democrats—a genuine
mandate to clean up “the mess in Washington.”</p>

<span class="fs150">Army-McCarthy—A Claim of Secrecy Unlimited</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">On the morning of May 17, 1954, the klieg-lighted Senate
Caucus Room was jammed with spectators. Near the end
of the huge table at the front of the room, Senator Joseph
R. McCarthy hunched over a microphone, reviling the
Eisenhower administration. He claimed that high officials
of the Eisenhower administration were arbitrarily silencing
witnesses from the executive branch, and in doing so were
preventing him from defending himself.</p>

<p>It was the eighteenth day of the already famous Army-McCarthy
hearings, an exciting political drama that held the
attention of an estimated 20 million television viewers. Over
the weeks the Senator had sneered at Army Secretary Robert
T. Stevens and anyone else who disagreed with him. His
smirking disrespect and heavy-handed humor had already
cooled the enthusiasm of many of his followers. Some had
even turned against him. Senator McCarthy, in short, had
created the worst possible climate in which to make any
appeal to fair play or decency. And yet the Wisconsin Republican
was now making such an appeal and would soon
be receiving some sympathetic comment from Democratic
as well as Republican senators.</p>

<p>The point at issue was simple: Should Army Counsel John
Adams be required to testify as to conversations at a meeting
at the Justice Department on January 21, 1954? Adams had
already testified to being present on that day with Attorney<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
General Herbert Brownell, Jr., Deputy Attorney General
William P. Rogers, Presidential Assistant Sherman Adams,
White House Administrative Assistant Gerald D. Morgan,
and United Nations Ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge. The
meeting had been called to try to find ways to curb Senator
McCarthy’s free-wheeling investigation of the loyalty-security
program in the Defense Department.</p>

<p>When, following this testimony on May 14, the Senate
committee members asked for information about the conversations,
Adams balked. He said that “instructions of the
Executive Branch” barred him from telling of the conversations
at that key meeting on January 21. Committee members
were concerned. How could they obtain the evidence
necessary to draw a conclusion on the hearings if they were
to be barred from all “high-level discussions of the Executive
Branch”?</p>

<p>The Army-McCarthy hearings centered on charges and
countercharges involving Army Secretary Stevens, John G.
Adams, Defense Department General Counsel H. Struve
Hensel, Senator Joseph McCarthy, Roy M. Cohn, and
Francis P. Carr. Cohn was chief counsel for McCarthy’s
Permanent Investigating Subcommittee, and Carr was chief
investigator.</p>

<p>The Department of the Army alleged that Senator McCarthy,
Cohn, and Carr had improperly used the power of
the McCarthy subcommittee to obtain preferential treatment
for Cohn’s pal, Private G. David Schine. It was contended
that the tough and aggressive little Cohn had tried to intimidate
the Army and Defense officials to get Schine a
commission or a special assignment as an assistant to the
Secretary of the Army, or a post in the Central Intelligence
Agency. It was also charged that Cohn had suggested that
Private Schine might be given a special assignment to work
with the McCarthy committee. In fact, Schine had been
drafted and after a short time on regular Army duty was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
permitted to leave his regular duties to work with Cohn on
the McCarthy committee investigations.</p>

<p>On the other side, Army Secretary Stevens contended
that McCarthy and Cohn had launched a vindictive probe of
the Army security programs in reprisal against those who had
not co-operated to grant special treatment to Private Schine.</p>

<p>Senator McCarthy countercharged that the Army tried to
blackmail his investigating subcommittee into dropping its
investigation of the Army loyalty-security setup by threatening
to circulate an embarrassing report about Cohn and
Schine. The Wisconsin Senator declared that his investigation
of the Army loyalty-security program was fully justified,
and reiterated his charge that Major Irving Peress had been
promoted by the Army despite his record as a “subversive.”
McCarthy did not deny that he had criticized Brigadier
General Ralph Zwicker as a “disgrace” in uniform. And he
renewed his assault on the Fort Monmouth Missile Research
Center as a place honeycombed with “Reds.”</p>

<p>It was easy to understand why the Eisenhower administration
held the January 21 meeting at the Justice Department
to decide how to handle Senator McCarthy. However, it was
not so easy to understand why, after testifying there had
been such a meeting, Army Counsel Adams refused to tell
what was said.</p>

<p>Senator Stuart Symington, the handsome Missouri Democrat,
was amazed that testimony would be barred on such
a crucial meeting. He declared that testimony on the January
21 meeting was essential to determine the responsibility
for the Defense Department’s attempt to stop Senator Joseph
McCarthy.</p>

<p>“This was a high-level discussion of the executive department,
and this witness [Adams] has been instructed not to
testify as to the interchange of views of people at that high-level
meeting,” explained Joseph N. Welch, the gentle-voiced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
Boston lawyer who was serving as a special counsel for the
Army.</p>

<p>“Does that mean we are going to get the information
about low-level discussions but not about high-level discussions?”
Senator Symington asked.</p>

<p>“That is only, sir, what I have been informed,” Welch
replied and then carefully made it clear he was not passing
on the right or wrong of the policy. “It isn’t a point of what
I like. It is a point of what the witness has been instructed.”</p>

<p>Senator Henry M. Jackson, the Washington Democrat,
was no McCarthy supporter, but he too was nettled by the
instructions given Adams by Deputy Defense Secretary
Robert B. Anderson. Jackson held that if the Defense Department
had any right to refuse to testify on high-level conversations,
then it had waived that right when Adams told of
the January 21 meeting and the participants.</p>

<p>“I think that maybe this testimony may be embarrassing to
the Administration, and I do not think that because it is
embarrassing to the Administration and favorable to Senator
McCarthy, that it ought to be deleted,” Senator Jackson
declared.</p>

<p>“I think this committee should find out now,” Jackson
continued, “whether it [the Administration policy] covers
just this conversation or whether it covers all conversations
that went on between the various officials within the Executive
Branch of Government ... [if] we are going to be
foreclosed here immediately from asking any further questions
relating to conversations between officials within the
Executive Branch. Heretofore, those conversations have
been coming in when they have been favorable. Now that
they are unfavorable [to the Administration], are they to be
excluded?”</p>

<p>The unfairness of allowing favorable testimony by a witness,
and then arbitrarily cutting off unfavorable testimony
was apparent to many observers, even through the steam of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
feeling that surrounded the Army-McCarthy hearings. To
justify such arbitrary secrecy, the Defense Department
needed all the prestige it could summon.</p>

<p>The answer to the problem, it was decided, would be a
letter from President Dwight D. Eisenhower to Defense
Secretary Charles E. Wilson. It had to be a letter of high
tone in which the popular President Eisenhower could convince
the public that some great principle was at stake. It
had to be general enough to avoid saying just why John
Adams couldn’t testify, but specific enough to give the impression
that the security of the nation and the foundations
of the Constitution were in danger if John Adams were
forced to talk. The letter drafted between Friday, May 14,
and Monday, May 17, carried the full impact of the prestige
of a highly popular President, but it obscured temporarily a
sweeping assumption of executive power to arbitrarily withhold
information (see Appendix A).</p>

<p>On Monday morning, May 17, John Adams filed the
Eisenhower letter with the Army-McCarthy committee and
a broad new doctrine of “executive privilege” was born.
The glowing phrases about a “proper separation of powers
between the Executive and Legislative Branches of the
Government,” misled the public and a good many newspaper
editorial writers and columnists, even though it did not fool
all the members of the Army-McCarthy committee.</p>

<p>President Eisenhower’s May 17, 1954, letter stated:</p>

<p>“Because it is essential to efficient and effective administration
that employees of the Executive Branch be in a position
to be completely candid in advising with each other on
official matters, and because it is not in the public interest
that any of their conversations or communications, or any
documents or reproductions, concerning such advice be disclosed,
you will instruct employees of your Department that
in all of their appearances before the Subcommittee of the
Senate Committee on Government Operations regarding the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
inquiry now before it they are not to testify to any such
conversations or communications or to produce any such
documents or reproductions. This principle must be maintained
regardless of who would benefit by such disclosure.</p>

<p>“I direct this action so as to maintain the proper separation
of powers between the Executive and Legislative
Branches of the Government in accordance with my responsibilities
under the Constitution. This separation is vital to
preclude the exercise of arbitrary power by any branch of
Government.”</p>

<p>The Eisenhower letter also stated that “throughout our
history the President has withheld information whenever
he found that what was sought was confidential or its disclosure
would be incompatible with the public interest or
jeopardize the safety of the Nation.” The letter gave the
impression that from George Washington down, a number
of Presidents had taken action analogous to the silencing
of John Adams.</p>

<p>How was the “public interest or the safety of the Nation”
to be jeopardized by Army Counsel John Adams’ telling
of a meeting on strategy to curb Senator McCarthy’s investigations?</p>

<p>If this Eisenhower letter was “to preclude the exercise of
arbitrary power by any branch of Government,” then who
was to stop the executive branch from such arbitrary silencing
of witnesses?</p>

<p>Were the Army-McCarthy investigating committee and
other committees of Congress to be barred from obtaining
information on all “conversations or communications, or any
documents or reproductions, concerning advice” within the
executive branch?</p>

<p>These were the questions that immediately arose in the
minds of Senator Jackson, Senator Symington, and Senator
John L. McClellan, the Arkansas Democrat. Senator Everett
Dirksen, the honey-voiced Illinois Republican, and Karl<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
Mundt, the South Dakota Republican who was serving as
chairman, also expressed some concern, although privately.</p>

<p>Stern-faced Senator McClellan was not awed by the popularity
of President Eisenhower or by the fact that Senator McCarthy
was a highly unpopular figure at that point. He declared
that if the barrier to any testimony on the January 21
meeting prevailed, then it would be impossible to establish
whether John Adams, Army Secretary Stevens, or some
higher officials were responsible for directing actions complained
of by Senator McCarthy, Roy Cohn, and Private
Schine.</p>

<p>“If the committee is going to be left in a dilemma of not
knowing whether the Secretary [Stevens] is responsible for
the action taken after that date [January 21], or whether
the responsibility is at a higher level, then we will never be
able to completely discharge our responsibility in this proceeding,”
Senator McClellan said.</p>

<p>Senator Jackson expressed the view that the secrecy policy
left the committee “in a dilemma of passing on testimony that
is incomplete. I think ... that the Executive Branch is doing
a great injustice to this committee and to all of the principals
in this controversy by exercising the power which the
President has, very late in the proceedings.”</p>

<p>There was no question that President Eisenhower’s letter
had stalled the hearings at a crucial moment. If witnesses
could not testify on an essential point, then there was little
more that could be learned.</p>

<p>“I must admit that I am somewhat at a loss as to know
what to do at the moment,” Senator McCarthy said. “One of
the subjects of this inquiry is to find out who was responsible
for succeeding in calling off the hearing of Communist
infiltration in Government. That the hearing was called off,
no one can question.”</p>

<p>McCarthy continued: “At this point, I find out there is no
way of ever getting at the truth, because we do find that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
charges were conceived, instigated, at a meeting [of January
21] which was testified to by Mr. Adams.</p>

<p>“I don’t think the President is responsible for this,” the
Wisconsin Republican said in expressing his views that
others had conceived the idea of silencing Adams and had
merely obtained President Eisenhower’s signature to accomplish
their purpose. “I don’t think his judgment is that
bad.”</p>

<p>“There is no reason why anyone should be afraid of the
facts, of the truth, that came out of that meeting,” Senator
McCarthy thundered. “It is a very important meeting. It
doesn’t have to do with security matters. It doesn’t have to
do with national security. It merely has to do with why these
charges were filed.</p>

<p>“The question is ... how far can the President go? Who
all can he order not to testify? If he can order the Ambassador
to the U. N. [Henry Cabot Lodge] not to testify about
something having nothing to do with the U. N., but a deliberate
smear against my staff, then ... any President can,
by an executive order, keep the facts from the American
people.”</p>

<p>Senator McCarthy brought up the 1952 campaign in
which government secrecy had been a key issue: “I do think
that someone ... should contact the President immediately
and point out to him ... that he and I and many of us
campaigned and promised the American people that if they
would remove our Democrat friends from control of the
Government, then we would no longer engage in Government
by secrecy, whitewash and cover-up.”</p>

<p>It was a pathetic plea from a man who by now had completely
destroyed his public image by his own brutal performance.
His voice was raucous. His heavy beard gave
him a rough, almost uncouth appearance despite his efforts
to modify it by shaving during the noon recess.</p>

<p>Still, he hammered on. “I think that these facts should be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
brought to the President because the American people will
not stand for such as this, Mr. Chairman. They will not stand
for a cover-up halfway through a hearing.”</p>

<p>Seldom had there been more right on the side of McCarthy,
but seldom had there been fewer people on his side.
Many people who at first had been inclined to approve Joe
McCarthy as “doing some good against the Communists,”
had been antagonized by his television image. Many editorial
pages of a press that was normally much more objective
had developed an attitude that anything that is bad for Joe
McCarthy is good for the country.</p>

<p>Public sentiment against him was so strong that I did not
believe it could have been changed to his favor—even if the
committee had succeeded in eliciting testimony on the January
21, 1954, meeting and no matter how embarrassing it
might have been to the Eisenhower administration.</p>

<p>There remained, nevertheless, the possibility that the
Eisenhower letter could be used again. I was shocked at the
wording of it. On the face of it, it seemed to extend the claim
of “executive privilege” to prohibit Congress the access to
<em>any</em> records or testimony that might involve communications
within the executive branch. The letter was a directive with
regard to excluding testimony in one hearing—the Army-McCarthy
hearing. However, it was certainly broad enough
that the Defense Department could use it to block any
investigation.</p>

<p>Moreover, if an administration could successfully block
any probe of high-level discussions in the Defense establishment,
why couldn’t it use that same “executive privilege” to
block any investigation in any other executive agency? The
thought disturbed me. The Teapot Dome scandals of the
Harding administration could have been buried if those
officials had applied even the mildest interpretation of “executive
privilege” set down by President Eisenhower in the
May 17 letter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span></p>

<p>If cabinet officers and subordinate officials had refused to
testify about the Teapot Dome affair on grounds of “confidential
executive communications,” it could have stifled the
entire investigation by Senator Thomas Walsh, the Montana
Democrat. Under the “executive privilege” theory, Secretary
of Navy Edwin Denby and Secretary of Interior Albert B.
Fall could have refused to give testimony or produce records
of events leading up to the leasing of the Teapot Dome oil
reserves. Fall’s crimes might never have been uncovered,
and he would have avoided the exposure and conviction.</p>

<p>Similarly, the tax scandals of the Truman administration
could have been buried by claiming that all papers except
those involving final decisions were “confidential executive
communications.” It had been vital to learn the nature of
advice and recommendations of both high-level and low-level
officials on settlements of huge tax cases. Attorney
General J. Howard McGrath could have claimed that his
conversations with T. Lamar Caudle, the Assistant Attorney
General in charge of the Tax Division, were “confidential
executive business.”</p>

<p>Caudle and White House Aide Matthew Connelly could
have claimed that their communications were “confidential
executive business.” As it was, the Caudle-Connelly communications
were actually used as the basis of criminal
charges on which Caudle and Connelly were convicted and
sent to prison. A number of other officials of the Internal
Revenue Service were convicted on charges arising out of
revelation of the “advice and recommendations” they gave
that were part of a huge tax “fix” operation.</p>

<p>I talked to several members of the Army-McCarthy committee,
and with several of my newspaper colleagues, Democratic
and Republican senators alike were disturbed at this
seemingly limitless claim for “executive privilege.” They
hoped that the Eisenhower administration had written the
letter for just this one hearing and had used the broad<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
language merely to avoid an impression that Senator McCarthy
was being singled out for special treatment. Among
the newspaper reporters the attitude was that Joe McCarthy
was getting about what he had coming to him; there was
little concern over what use might be made of the precedent
in other investigations.</p>

<p>Many of the reporters had been misled by a memorandum
that accompanied the Eisenhower letter. It said, in effect,
that President Eisenhower was doing no more than George
Washington and many other Presidents had done. By invoking
such names as George Washington and Thomas
Jefferson, the memorandum made it possible to pass off the
Eisenhower letter as a mere “clarification” of an old and settled
principle. A close reading of “the precedents” disclosed
in fact that President Washington actually <em>opposed</em> withholding
information from Congress. (See Chapter I.) He
once refused to deliver treaty papers to the House but only
because the Senate, not the House, had jurisdiction to ratify
treaties.</p>

<p>President Jefferson had taken papers into his personal
custody in connection with the Aaron Burr case, and thus
defied the federal court by declaring that the only way the
papers could be reached would be by impeaching him. He
was right. The law is quite settled on this point; neither the
courts nor the Congress can compel the President to testify
or produce personal letters, papers, and memorandums. President
Jefferson eventually did send the documents subpoenaed
by Chief Justice Marshall. But even if Jefferson had
refused to produce these documents, it would hardly seem
to be an adequate reason for allowing a lawyer for the Army
Department to refuse to testify about a meeting with a
cabinet officer and several White House aides.</p>

<p>The late Ed Milne, of the Washington Bureau of the
Providence <cite>Journal</cite>, shared my concern. He and I each wrote
stories demonstrating how the Truman tax scandals and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
Harding Teapot Dome scandals could have been hidden
forever if “executive privilege” had barred testimony of all
high-level conversations.</p>

<p>We also reminded our readers of the Republican reaction
to the ducking and evasion of the Truman administration
between 1946 and 1952. Senator Homer Ferguson, the Michigan
Republican, was chairman of one of the committees that
investigated the Truman administration in the late 1940s.
His chief counsel at the time was William P. Rogers, who
later became Eisenhower’s Attorney General and a chief
advocate of the ultimate in executive secrecy. Only a year
before Eisenhower’s election (September 27, 1951), Ferguson
spoke out bluntly on the issue of suppression of facts by
the executive departments: “It may be said that this practice
of suppressing information in the executive department got
its big start back in March, 1948. The Senator from Michigan
[himself] was then chairman of the Senate Investigations
Subcommittee and was investigating things that could
be embarrassing to the administration. The subject of the investigation
was the operation of the Government’s loyalty
program, revolving around the case of William Remington.”</p>

<p>Senator Ferguson continued: “An executive order was
issued, placing certain files under the direct and exclusive
jurisdiction of the President. On occasion files were taken to
the White House in order that they could not be subpoenaed.
In the course of our hearings, an admiral was able to tell the
Senator from Michigan, off the record, the fact that because
of an order by the President of the United States he was not
permitted to testify.”</p>

<p>As I have shown (in Chapter III), the Truman administration
did try to hide embarrassing facts from Congress. President
Truman issued an executive order placing certain
personnel files under a secrecy blanket, and on some occasions
he ordered files delivered to his personal custody at
the White House so they could not be reached by subpoena.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
His administration stalled investigations of flagrant crimes
for months. But President Truman never asserted any constitutional
right by which all high-level officials could claim an
“executive privilege” to refuse to testify or produce records.</p>

<p>The persistent, hard-hitting inquiries of Committee Counsel
William P. Rogers made the Truman administration so
frantic in 1948 and 1949 that a staff lawyer in the Justice
Department was asked to prepare a memorandum on the
precedents set by earlier Presidents who had withheld information
from Congress. However, that memorandum was
regarded as too insubstantial to use. The Truman administration
relied instead on ducking and dodging to avoid embarrassment.
It sensed correctly that the press and the public
would have been outraged if it had tried to pull down a total
secrecy curtain in the midst of investigations of the five percenters,
the influence peddlers, and the loyalty cases.</p>

<p>What Truman would not do, however, the highly popular
President Eisenhower did do. Ironically, his May 17 letter
caused hardly a ripple of criticism. On the contrary, most
editorial pages praised President Eisenhower for expressing
some fine new theory on the U. S. Constitution or wrote off
the letter as an historically unimportant, one-shot claim of
secrecy.</p>

<p>I called one editor friend the day after such an approving
editorial appeared, and commented that the Eisenhower
doctrine of “executive privilege” could bar Congress from
practically any executive papers containing “opinions, advice
or recommendations.”</p>

<p>“This will set the ‘Freedom of Information’ cause back
fifty years, if it is not criticized and stopped now,” I said.</p>

<p>My editor friend said he thought that there might have
been some loyalty file discussed at the January 21 meeting,
and that this would be a justification for refusing testimony.</p>

<p>I told him that no one had claimed that loyalty files were
discussed, and that if this had been the reason for the secrecy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
then it should have been stated. Also, I pointed out that
while discussion of a loyalty file might give some justifications
for limiting testimony, the limitation should only cover
that subject and not the whole meeting.</p>

<p>The editor agreed with me that the broad language of the
Eisenhower letter constituted a dangerous precedent. But
he didn’t believe that any administration would ever try to
invoke the total arbitrary “executive privilege.”</p>

<p>Just how wrong events would prove him to be was not then
easy to predict. Indeed, the whole story of the Army-McCarthy
hearings had by this time taken second news
billing to the United States Supreme Court ruling on school
segregation. The unanimous segregation decision came out
on May 17, 1954—the same date as the Eisenhower letter to
Wilson. That segregation decision now dominated discussions
of constitutional law. And the few persons who did
stop to think about the inherent threat in the broad use of
secrecy could hardly get emotional about it—as long as the
only victims appeared to be Senator McCarthy and his little
knot of followers.</p>

<span class="fs150">Another Blow at Senator Joe</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">When the Eisenhower administration took office in January
1953, I had had high hopes that arbitrary government
secrecy would be ended. As a candidate, the President had
talked much of his interest in open government and had
pledged to make all but national security information available
to the public. So had the Vice President, Richard M.
Nixon.</p>

<p>As late as November 6, 1953, Attorney General Herbert
Brownell, Jr., was continuing to stress the Republican party’s
interest in eliminating secrecy policies of the Truman administration.
In Chicago, before a convention of Associated
Press Managing Editors, Brownell said he was “very much
aware of the great importance of seeing to it that the obstacles
to the free flow of information are kept to an absolute
minimum.</p>

<p>“I would like to call attention to some of the procedures
which we established,” Brownell said. “At the very outset of
the new Administration, we provided that any pardons or
commutations of sentence shall be a matter of public record.
Throughout the prior Administration, these executive actions
were taken secretly, for political purposes and over the objection
of the Office of the Pardon Attorney.</p>

<p>“We also started the policy of making a matter of public
record matters which our predecessors buried in secrecy,
such as settlements of all types of cases which we handle and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
involve monetary considerations, such as tax claims, damage
suits and Alien Property settlements. We do not contend that
we have achieved perfection in our efforts to provide a full
flow of information. But we are working on it and each day
find new ways to do our part.”</p>

<p>At this same meeting, Attorney General Brownell announced
that President Eisenhower was revoking a much
criticized executive order by President Truman dealing with
defense information. He said President Eisenhower was
issuing a new order which “attains the required balance between
the need to protect certain types of defense information,
and the need for keeping the citizens of a republic as
fully informed as possible concerning what their government
is doing.</p>

<p>“President Eisenhower considers the free flow of information
from the Government to the people to be basic to the
good health of the Nation,” Brownell told the editors. He
declared that under the Truman administration there “was a
tendency to follow the dangerous policy heretofore used by
dictator nations of authorizing government officials to use
the term ‘National Security’ indiscriminately, and thereby
throw a veil of secrecy over many items which historically
have been open to the public in this country.”</p>

<p>The Attorney General said he viewed the new Republican
policy as an opportunity to “demonstrate to all the world the
vivid contrast between our system of government, which believes
in and practices freedom of the press, and the Communist
system, which regards the concept of freedom of
information as a threat to the continuance of its tyrannical
rule.”</p>

<p>Such attitudes in November 1953 were difficult to reconcile
with those of May 1954, when the same Attorney General
was helping fashion a policy that was more devastating
to a free flow of information than simply refusing to give
information to the press. The May 17, 1954, letter from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
President Eisenhower to the Defense Department said in
essence that any high officials of the Defense establishment
might refuse to produce records or testify even when
<ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;original text: suppoenaed">subpoenaed</ins>
by a properly constituted congressional committee
that was acting within its jurisdiction.</p>

<p>The Army-McCarthy hearings that had given rise to the
famous letter ended on June 17, 1954. However, it was not
necessary to wait for the official reports made public on
October 30, 1954, to know that Senator McCarthy was finished
as a political power—and that the administration would
use the “executive privilege” precedent again.</p>

<p>As an aftermath of the Army-McCarthy hearings, a charge
was filed that Senator McCarthy had conducted himself
in a manner “unbecoming a member of the United States
Senate.” And on August 2, 1954, the U. S. Senate decided
by the overwhelming vote of 75 to 12 to investigate Senator
McCarthy’s conduct.</p>

<p>Senator Arthur V. Watkins, a Utah Republican, was
named chairman of the select McCarthy Censure Committee
to determine recommendations on Senator McCarthy’s conduct.
In barely more than a month Chairman Watkins ran
smack into a roadblock of “executive privilege.”</p>

<p>The subject of inquiry was Senator McCarthy’s severe
tongue lashing of Brigadier General Ralph Zwicker, of Camp
Kilmer, N. J. Major General Kirke B. Lawton, a former commanding
general of Fort Monmouth, N. J., refused to testify
about conversations with General Zwicker. He claimed “executive
privilege” under the May 17, 1954, letter from President
Eisenhower.</p>

<p>Edward Bennett Williams, who was serving as counsel for
Senator McCarthy, questioned the applicability of the May
17 letter: “Don’t you know, General, that order of May 17,
1954, referred only to the Government Operations Committee
and the hearing then in session which was commonly
known as the Army-McCarthy hearing?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span></p>

<p>General Lawton replied that he had been advised that
the May 17 letter “not only applied to the so-called Mundt
committee [the Special Committee for the Army-McCarthy
hearings] but it applies to this or any other.”</p>

<p>Chairman Watkins excused General Lawton and wrote
Defense Secretary Charles E. Wilson asking clarification.
Defense Secretary Wilson replied that Generals Lawton and
Zwicker would be allowed to testify and produce documents
unless their action would be “in violation of national security
regulations or a violation of the President’s order of May
17, 1954.”</p>

<p>There could be little doubt now that the Defense Department
intended to make the May 17, 1954, letter a part of its
basic doctrine with all of the great blanket of secrecy that
this would provide. I was now more concerned than ever, for
I had hoped that the May 17 letter was the one-shot secrecy
claim that so many of my colleagues thought it was. But
again the name of Joe McCarthy was mixed up in the investigation,
and in 1954 it would have been difficult to get
any cool thinking on a subject that remotely touched on the
controversial Wisconsin Republican.</p>

<p>Still, I couldn’t help worrying that the new and expanded
doctrine of “executive privilege” was just too convenient a
cover for those who wished to hide their activities from
Congress, the press, or the public. It could be used by the
incompetent as well as the corrupt.</p>

<p>This doctrine of an “inherent right” of persons in the executive
departments to refuse testimony or documents threatened
our whole system of government. It seemed a naked
claim of an authority for unlimited secrecy, without regard
for laws or the spirit of a democracy. By claiming a right
to withhold all information on opinions, conclusions, recommendations,
or suggestions, this doctrine could allow the
secrecy blanket to be dropped over virtually every document
in most agencies, for there are few governmental documents<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
that do not contain some opinions or suggestions. It carried
within it, in short, the seeds of dictatorship.</p>

<p>It seemed strange to me that this doctrine would be set
forth in the administration of a President who would be
regarded as one of the mildest Chief Executives, and certainly
one of the least inclined toward dictatorial action. I
was not worried that President Eisenhower would try to use
it as a tool for totalitarianism. But with this doctrine in
force a man who was inclined toward totalitarian methods
might readily administer the laws as he pleased.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI<br>
<span class="fs150">Secrecy Fix on Dixon and Yates</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">Not until the summer of 1955 did it become apparent that
the May 17, 1954, Eisenhower letter would be used on matters
unrelated to Senator Joseph R. McCarthy. Throughout
the fall and winter of 1954, I spoke and wrote about the
potential danger of “executive privilege” as it had been applied
in the Army-McCarthy hearings and in the McCarthy
censure hearings. A few persons saw it my way. But the general
tendency to believe that the letter was written solely
to deal with Senator McCarthy held fast, and a general faith
prevailed that the Eisenhower administration would not use
it to cover up mistakes, corruption, or improprieties.</p>

<p>Then suddenly, in June 1955, the White House reinvoked
the letter as justification for refusing to make records available
to a Senate committee investigating the Dixon-Yates
contract.</p>

<p>First, Budget Director Rowland R. Hughes used “executive
privilege” to conceal testimony and documents requested
by Senator Estes Kefauver, the Tennessee Democrat
in charge of the investigation.</p>

<p>Then J. Sinclair Armstrong, the chairman of the Securities
and Exchange Commission, used “executive privilege” to
justify his refusal to disclose conversations with Presidential
Assistant Sherman Adams relative to postponing a hearing
on Dixon-Yates financing.</p>

<p>Also, Sherman Adams claimed the “privilege” not to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
required to testify about his talks with Armstrong or about
other activity in the Dixon-Yates contract development.</p>

<p>At last a few of the Democrats who had been only too
glad to see “executive privilege” invoked against Senator
McCarthy opened their eyes. The realization of the danger
dawned too late, however, for it would take more than a few
weeks to upset a precedent that only a year earlier had been
generally viewed as praiseworthy.</p>

<p>While the Army-McCarthy hearings and the McCarthy
censure affair dominated the news, top-level officials in the
Eisenhower administration had been quietly at work arranging
for the Mississippi Valley Generating Company
to furnish 600,000 kilowatts of electricity to the Tennessee
Valley Authority. The Mississippi Valley Generating Company
contract ultimately became known as the “Dixon-Yates”
contract because of the two men responsible for its
creation. They were Edgar H. Dixon, president of Middle
South Utilities, Inc., and Eugene A. Yates, chairman of the
board of The Southern Company. Both firms act as holding
companies for utilities operating in Arkansas, Georgia, Louisiana,
Mississippi, and Alabama. Dixon and Yates joined
forces to create the Mississippi Valley Generating Company,
an operating subsidiary in West Memphis, Ark. The Dixon-Yates
contract was reported to be for the purpose of replacing
power in the Tennessee Valley Authority area that was
used by the Atomic Energy Commission.</p>

<p>Lewis L. Strauss, then chairman of the Atomic Energy
Commission (AEC), and Joseph Dodge, then Director of
the Budget, were active in pushing this contract. Chairman
Strauss pushed it despite the fact that a majority of the
Atomic Energy Commissioners were opposed to such a contract
on grounds there was no Atomic Energy Commission
installation near West Memphis, Ark., and the power was to
be used in Memphis, Tenn.</p>

<p>The Eisenhower administration had opposed the Tennessee<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
Valley Authority proposal to build a steam plant at
Fulton, Tenn., with a capacity of 500,000 kilowatts to provide
for the power needs of Memphis, plus a surplus for
industrial expansion. Budget Director Dodge opposed the
Fulton steam plant and axed the 90 million dollars requested
from the budget in 1953. Gordon Clapp, at that time chairman
of the TVA, then asked that to offset the loss of the
Fulton steam plant the AEC consumption of TVA power be
cut sharply. It was at this point that Budget Director Dodge
turned to the AEC in an effort to get that agency to find ways
to obtain power from a private company.</p>

<p>The Dixon-Yates contract idea developed over a period of
months in 1953 and early 1954. Dozens of conferences were
held in which one of the important figures was Adolphe
Wenzell, a vice president and director of the First Boston
Corporation. Wenzell was an engineer and an expert in the
cost of construction of public utility plants. From May 20,
1953, to September 3, 1953, he made studies and issued reports
on TVA power plant costs. In January 1954, Rowland
R. Hughes, then Deputy Director of the Budget, asked Wenzell
to assist the Budget Bureau on the Dixon-Yates contract.
Wenzell agreed and, until April 10, 1954, continued to participate
in the Dixon-Yates negotiations.</p>

<p>Wenzell continued to draw his salary from First Boston
Corporation, and received travel costs and a per diem allowance
from the government for his services for the Budget
Bureau. Since First Boston Corporation was slated to be underwriter
of the Mississippi Valley Generating Company, a
question was raised by his associates about the propriety of
Wenzell’s services to the Budget Bureau and to First Boston—a
firm that had a pecuniary interest in the Dixon-Yates
contract agreement.</p>

<p>As the Dixon-Yates contract moved toward completion, a
lawyer for the law firm of Sullivan &amp; Cromwell told Wenzell
that before First Boston should take part in the financing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
for Dixon-Yates, Wenzell “should make clear that he had
severed his entire relations with the Bureau of the Budget.”</p>

<p>In the summer of 1954, a few complaints were raised about
the Dixon-Yates contract. There was also opposition to the
Dixon-Yates contract within the Tennessee Valley Authority
as well as by a majority of the Atomic Energy Commissioners.
But on June 16, 1954, Rowland Hughes, by then promoted
to Director of the Budget, wrote to the Atomic Energy
Commission:</p>

<p>“The President has asked me to instruct the Atomic Energy
Commission to proceed with negotiations with the sponsors
of the proposal made by Messrs. Dixon and Yates with a
view of signing a definite contract.”</p>

<p>The contract was signed, and in the following weeks the
number of Democratic complaints mounted. The complaints
hit a number of points. The Democrats contended that the
Dixon-Yates contract could cost the government from 107
million to 120 million dollars over a period of twenty-five
years, but that in the end the government wouldn’t own the
plant. This was compared to the 90 million cost for the Fulton
steam plant which the TVA wanted to construct.</p>

<p>The debate revolved largely around the question of private
versus public power (or TVA). Many Democrats held
that the Eisenhower administration was allowing the public
treasury to be milked by Big Business in the same fashion
the Harding administration had permitted the exploitation
of Navy oil reserves in the Teapot Dome scandals.</p>

<p>Democratic National Chairman Stephen Mitchell hit a
sensitive nerve in early August 1954 when he implied that
President Eisenhower had direct responsibility for the Dixon-Yates
contract. He charged that one of President Eisenhower’s
golfing associates was a director of The Southern
Company, one of the two holding companies that had
established the Mississippi Valley Generating Company.
Mitchell’s office identified the man as Bobby Jones, former<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
amateur and professional golfing champion. No evidence
was ever produced to support the insinuation that Jones
influenced Dixon-Yates decisions.</p>

<p>President Eisenhower was furious that his associations
would be subject to such charges, and in his August 17, 1954,
press conference he offered to disclose all the events leading
up to the Dixon-Yates contract.</p>

<p>“Any one of you here present might singly or in an investigation
group go to the Bureau of the Budget, or to the
Chief of the Atomic Energy Commission, and get the complete
record from the inception of the idea [of the Dixon-Yates
contract] to this very minute, and it is all yours.”</p>

<p>Four days later, on August 21, 1954, the Atomic Energy
Commission released what was purported to be a full chronology
of all events in the development of the Dixon-Yates
contract. The names of Wenzell and Paul Miller, assistant
vice president of First Boston Corporation, had appeared in
an original draft. However, the names of both of these First
Boston Corporation officials—Wenzell and Miller—were eliminated
from the chronology that was given to the press.</p>

<p>On the surface, it appeared that President Eisenhower had
met charges of improper activity with a frank and open
report on the whole record of the Dixon-Yates contract. Not
until February 18, 1955, did anyone charge that the chronology
was not a full truthful report. On that day, Senator
Lister Hill, the Alabama Democrat, made a Senate speech
in which he charged Wenzell with a dual role in the Dixon-Yates
negotiations. He questioned the propriety of Wenzell’s
being a financial adviser to Dixon-Yates while at the same
time serving as an adviser to the United States Government
on the Dixon-Yates contract.</p>

<p>Spokesmen for the Eisenhower administration such as
Budget Director Rowland R. Hughes denied there was any
dual role by Wenzell in the Dixon-Yates contract. As late as
June 27, 1955, Budget Director Hughes testified before a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
Senate committee that “I was told it was not true.” He said
he didn’t know that First Boston had anything to do with
the financing of Dixon-Yates.</p>

<p>The speech by Senator Hill caused understandable concern
in the White House and among the top officials of the
First Boston Corporation. Revelation of a “conflict of interest”
could spoil the entire 107-million-dollar contract and its
profits for First Boston. It could undo what President Eisenhower
and many top subordinates deemed an important
block to the spread of the Tennessee Valley Authority.</p>

<p>Of immediate importance was a 6.5-million-dollar appropriation
slated to go to the House of Representatives on
June 13, 1955. The appropriation was for a transmission
line from the Tennessee Valley Authority to the point where
it would pick up power from the Mississippi Valley Generating
Company in the middle of the Mississippi River.</p>

<p>On June 11, 1955, Sherman Adams telephoned to J. Sinclair
Armstrong, chairman of the Securities Exchange Commission.
He requested that the SEC hold up hearings on
debt financing of the Dixon-Yates contract until after the
House had finished work on the 6.5-million-dollar appropriation.
Wenzell was among the witnesses scheduled to testify
before the SEC, and testimony on Wenzell’s full role in
Dixon-Yates could have had a devastating impact on the
appropriation. The hearings were postponed.</p>

<p>Finally, on June 28, 1955, Budget Director Hughes revealed
that the Eisenhower administration was going to try
to pull down the secrecy curtain on the investigation of
Dixon-Yates. The claim of “executive privilege” was to be
the vehicle.</p>

<p>Hughes was being questioned by Senator Estes Kefauver,
regarding a request for the opportunity to examine all memoranda,
documents, and reports pertinent to the Dixon-Yates
contract. By this time it was abundantly clear to the Kefauver<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
subcommittee that the chronology released on August
21, 1954, was intentionally incomplete.</p>

<p>Indirectly Hughes moved to “executive privilege.”</p>

<p>“As pointed out to you,” he told Senator Kefauver, “we
operate under the President’s general instructions with regard
to interoffice and intraoffice staff material, that such
material is not to be made public.</p>

<p>“All documents which involve final decisions of public
policy have of course already been made public,” Hughes
said in an effort to give the impression that the administration
had complied with the President’s pledge of frankness.
“You [Kefauver] pointed out that you interpreted the President’s
statement at a press conference last fall to indicate
that they [the “executive privilege” claims] did not apply to
this case. I have checked on this matter and I am authorized
by the President to state that his general instructions stand
but that we, of course, stand on the decision to make every
pertinent paper or document that can be made public under
this ruling available to you.”</p>

<p>Hughes was trying to give an impression of frankness,
while at the same time reserving to the administration the
right to withhold any Dixon-Yates information they wished to
regard as “interoffice and intraoffice staff material.” Hughes
continued:</p>

<p>“A quick review of our files last night disclosed no other
papers or documents to be added to the somewhat voluminous
releases already made, but we shall make a full and
careful search in the next few days to confirm this or to
pick out material, if any, which should be added to that
previously released.”</p>

<p>Hughes had left the Eisenhower administration an “out”
on any omissions of material. Next he sought to absolve
Wenzell from any connection with the Dixon-Yates contract.</p>

<p>“We have also reviewed the report which Mr. Wenzell
made as an adviser in September, 1953, and find that that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
had nothing to do with the Dixon-Yates contract and, as a
confidential document under the general ruling [of “executive
privilege”], therefore cannot be made available to your
committee.”</p>

<p>Although Hughes concluded with a promise to “co-operate
where we can do so properly,” he made it clear the Eisenhower
administration was still going to use the “executive
privilege” claim to secrecy if it wanted to refuse testimony
or records.</p>

<p>Up to this time, high administration officials had deleted
information, twisted the record, engaged in half truths and
full deception to obscure the story of the Dixon-Yates contract.
Now they were seeking to use the name of President
Eisenhower, and give the impression that some constitutional
principle was involved in hiding the records.</p>

<p>Senator Kefauver took to the Senate floor to lash out at
the concealment of records and testimony in the Dixon-Yates
investigation. At the presidential press conference on June
30, 1955, Frank Van De Linden, of the Nashville <cite>Banner</cite>,
forced the issue with President Eisenhower:</p>

<p>“Senator Kefauver charged on the Senate floor yesterday
that the Budget Bureau was trying to conceal what he called
a scandal in the Dixon-Yates contract negotiation regarding
the employment of Mr. Adolphe Wenzell, of the First Boston
Corporation,” Van De Linden said. “Senator Knowland says
there is no corruption in it, and that he thinks you were just
trying to help the Tennessee Valley get some power. I wonder
if Mr. Hughes, of the Budget Bureau, had cleared with
you his refusal to give Mr. Kefauver the information he was
asking down there?”</p>

<p>President Eisenhower answered: “Mr. Hughes came to see
me, went over the situation, and I repeated the general instructions—I
think that I expressed some in front of this body—that
every single pertinent paper in the Yates-Dixon contract,
from its inception until the final writing of the contract,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
would be made available, I think I said, at that time to the
press, much less to any committee.”</p>

<p>After seeming to approve an open record, he then qualified
it: “Now, I do stand on this: Nobody has a right to go in
and just ... wrecking the processes of Government by taking
every single file—and some of you have seen our file rooms
and know their size—and wrecking the entire filing system
and paralyzing the processes of Government while they are
going through them.”</p>

<p>The President rambled on: “There are—these files are filled
with every kind of personal note—I guess my own files are
filled with personal notes from my own staff all through; they
are honeycombed with them. Well, now, to drag those things
out where a man says to me, ‘I think so-and-so is a bad person
to appoint, to so-and-so, and you shouldn’t have him,’
all he had was his own opinion. You can’t drag those things
out and put them before the public with justice to anybody,
and we are not going to do it.”</p>

<p>President Eisenhower had engaged in a lot of conversation
unrelated to the information sought. Now he indicated that
he personally believed that officials of his administration
had already put out all pertinent documents:</p>

<p>“At the time that I gave those instructions, Mr. Hughes
and Mr. Strauss, whoever else was involved, got together every
single document that was pertinent to this thing and put
it out.”</p>

<p>The President concluded with a complete approval of the
Wenzell role: “Now, as far as the Wenzell report, Mr. Wenzell
was never called in or asked a single thing about the
Yates-Dixon contract. He was brought into—as a technical
adviser in the very early days when none of us here knew
about the bookkeeping methods of the TVA or anything else.
He was brought in as a technical adviser and nothing else
and before this contract was ever even proposed.”</p>

<p>President Eisenhower seemed to have no information<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
about Wenzell’s role after January 1954. His comments
seemed completely contrary to the testimony already taken
before the Kefauver Subcommittee on Antitrust and Monopoly.
I followed up the Van De Linden question.</p>

<p>“Mr. President,” I said. “A little while ago you stated that
Mr. Wenzell was never called in about the Yates-Dixon contract,
and there seemed to be some testimony before the
SEC and before a committee that he served as a consultant.
I wonder if you were—”</p>

<p>The President cut in to answer that “He [Wenzell] did
serve as a consultant at one time.”</p>

<p>“Of Dixon-Yates?” I asked it fast.</p>

<p>“No; I think—now, I will check this up,” the President
started. “My understanding is that quickly as the Dixon-Yates
thing came up he resigned, and we got as our consultant
a man named Adams from the Power Commission
here itself to come over and be consultant so as to have him
because he [Wenzell] was connected with a great Boston
financial company.”</p>

<p>“Mr. President,” I asked. “Had you been informed that he
had no connection at all with the Dixon-Yates—?”</p>

<p>“My understanding of it, and it may have been—that part
of it there may have been—an overlap of a week or two, there
I am not sure of,” President Eisenhower answered. It was
difficult to understand he had so little information on the key
issue at this late date.</p>

<p>“Would there be any change in your position on that if
there was material that he [Wenzell] had served as a
consultant on that [Dixon-Yates]?” I asked.</p>

<p>“If he had served as a consultant on that [Dixon-Yates]
and brought in a definite recommendation to us I would be
very delighted to make that public,” President Eisenhower
answered. “But I just don’t believe there is a thing in it about
it. However, I will have it checked again.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span></p>

<p>Noting the press conference statement, Senator Kefauver
fired off a quick letter to President Eisenhower:</p>

<p>“My Dear Mr. President: I have just been informed that
in answer to questions of the press today you are recorded
as saying that Mr. Adolphe H. Wenzell was never called in
or asked a single thing about the Dixon-Yates contract, and
that as quickly as the Dixon-Yates matter came up Mr. Wenzell
resigned. However, you say you will have it checked
again.”</p>

<p>Then Senator Kefauver followed up with a careful chronological
study of the testimony of Wenzell and other key
officials in the Eisenhower administration which showed
that Wenzell had been a consultant on the Dixon-Yates contract.
It also showed that high Eisenhower administration
officials knew, or should have known, the precise role that
Wenzell had filled.</p>

<p>At his next press conference, on July 6, 1955, President
Eisenhower said Wenzell’s role was perfectly “proper” in
Dixon-Yates, but indicated there was a chance the contract
might be canceled.</p>

<p>Senator Kefauver sought an explanation of the Sherman
Adams calls to the SEC that had postponed hearings on the
financial arrangements for Dixon-Yates at the crucial point
before the House took up the appropriation measure.</p>

<p>On July 21, Adams refused to testify before the Kefauver
investigating subcommittee. In a letter to Senator Kefauver
he stated that he could not give testimony because of his
confidential relationship to the President, and also because
“every fact as to which I might give testimony either has
been or could be testified to fully by other responsible government
officials.”</p>

<p>The same day Kenneth Fields, general manager of the
Atomic Energy Commission, wrote to Kefauver declining to
furnish documents on ground they were “privileged communications
within the executive branch.” Earlier, SEC<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
Chairman Armstrong had made his first refusal to testify on
his conversations with Sherman Adams.</p>

<p>Senator Kefauver replied to Adams that there had been
consistent claims of “executive privilege” that barred the investigators
from obtaining the truth.</p>

<p>“No official of the Government,” the Senator wrote, “no
matter how high his position can properly claim privilege
when a committee of Congress is seeking the facts in respect
to corruption.”</p>

<p>Senator Kefauver stated: “In these circumstances a claim
of privilege is tantamount to suppression of evidence of possible
crime and corruption. Not even the privilege of attorney-client
can be used for such a nefarious purpose.”</p>

<p>Sherman Adams hid out behind the protective walls of the
White House, unavailable for questioning by Congress and
unavailable for questioning by the press. “Executive privilege,”
as smoothly practiced by the Eisenhower administration,
made it appear that Adams was invulnerable to attack,
or even questioning, on any of his activities. Perhaps he <em>was</em>
the cold and clean New Hampshire granite of the legend of
Sherman Adams. Perhaps he <em>was</em> the dispassionate, efficient
barrier against the corrupting influences of personal and political
favoritism. But, even if Sherman Adams were the puritanic
guardian of good government as pictured, the idea of
surrounding any man’s activities with such arbitrary secrecy
was a bad principle. It was an open invitation to misuse of
power and influence that few could withstand.</p>

<p>At the July 27, 1955, press conference I questioned President
Eisenhower to determine what he knew of the activities
of Sherman Adams in the Dixon-Yates affair.</p>

<p>“Mr. President,” I said. “There has been testimony of the
SEC Chairman [J. Sinclair Armstrong] that Sherman Adams
intervened before the SEC, which was a quasi-judicial body.
Testimony was given by the chairman on that score.</p>

<p>“The Democrats are contending that there was something<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
improper in intervening with any quasi-judicial body. I wonder
if you looked into that and if you have any comment you
would like to make about it.”</p>

<p>The President replied that he had “looked into it only to
this extent: I am sure that Mr.—head of the commission—has
given the entire story. I understand that he is back before
the committee. And certainly if he has omitted any details,
he should give them now.”</p>

<p>The President continued: “And I believe that Governor
Adams has informed the Senate committee that he hasn’t a
single detail to add; that the story has been told and that is
all there is to it.”</p>

<p>Garnett Horner, the White House reporter for the Washington
<cite>Star</cite>, came in with another question:</p>

<p>“In connection with the Dixon-Yates matter, and in view
of the fact that the Senate investigation subcommittee recently
brought out the first time the part played in initiating
the Dixon-Yates contract by Adolphe Wenzell, of the First
Boston Corporation, which corporation later became the financing
agent for Dixon-Yates. In view of all that, do you
believe your directions last summer for disclosure of the complete
record in the case were carried out by the agencies
[the Bureau of the Budget and the Atomic Energy Commission]
concerned?”</p>

<p>President Eisenhower replied: “Well, I didn’t know that
anyone had alleged that he [Wenzell] was the initiator, because
no such statement has ever been made to me.</p>

<p>“But what I have done is this: I have gotten back Mr.
Dodge, who was Director of the Budget when all this was
done, when the 1954, I believe, policy on this statement, on
this whole proposition was made, and he is going now before
one of the committees.”</p>

<p>The President turned to Press Secretary James C. Hagerty
to ask: “Isn’t that correct?”</p>

<p>Hagerty answered, “Yes, sir.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span></p>

<p>The President continued: “He [Dodge] is going down before
one of the committees with instruction to do this: to
tell every possible item that has anything whatsoever to bear
on Dixon-Yates, and see whether we can get the whole list
of information properly coordinated and placed before the
people that are investigating it.”</p>

<p>President Eisenhower still had not answered the question
relative to whether he knew that his August 1954 order on
complete disclosure on Dixon-Yates had been violated. I followed
up the question of Garnett Horner:</p>

<p>“I hate to go back to Dixon-Yates again, but there was
one thing I don’t think was completely clear. There were
some AEC officials, Mr. Fields and Mr. Cook, who testified
that Mr. Wenzell’s name was knowingly eliminated from the
Dixon-Yates chronology; and, of course, they stated this was
on the recommendations of the Bureau of the Budget.</p>

<p>“I wonder if you knew anything of this, and if you did
know of it, if you would like to comment on whether you
thought it was important.”</p>

<p>[On July 21, 1955, Kenneth E. Fields, general manager,
Atomic Energy Commission, and Richard W. Cook, deputy
general manager, Atomic Energy Commission, testified before
the Senate Judiciary subcommittee. Fields identified
Cook as the man who prepared the chronology.</p>

<p>“The Bureau of the Budget suggested that we leave them
(the names of Wenzell and Miller) out,” Cook said in answer
to a question from Senator Joseph O’Mahoney.</p>

<p>“I can assure you that we did not try to conceal anything,”
Cook continued. “They just called to our attention certain
minor entries that ... didn’t appear to be appropriate.”</p>

<p>“So they suggested no other names that you leave out except
Wenzell and Miller?” Senator Kefauver asked.</p>

<p>“No; not that I recall,” Cook answered.]</p>

<p>The President knew little about the Dixon-Yates contract
even at this late date, more than a year after it had first been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
criticized by Democrats. His answer reflected his lack of
knowledge, as well as his desire to shut off further questions.</p>

<p>“I don’t intend to comment on it any more at all,” he said.
“Now, I think I have given to this conference time and again,
the basic elements of this whole development, and everything
I could possibly be expected to know about it.</p>

<p>“I said Mr. Dodge, who initiated this whole thing, is going
down before the committee to again begin the process
of taking this thing from its inception and following it
through until he turned [it] over to Mr. Hughes, and I believe
that Mr. Hughes is to be there if they want him again.</p>

<p>“Now, they [Dodge and Hughes] can tell the entire story,
and I don’t know exactly such details as that. How could I
be expected to know? I never heard of it.”</p>

<p>It would have been difficult to imagine a case that dramatized
more clearly the bad government that could fester under
arbitrary executive secrecy. President Eisenhower had
issued an order for a full chronology of events leading up to
the Dixon-Yates contract, but, instead, his subordinates had
put out a record edited to eliminate the names of persons
involved in a “conflict of interest.”</p>

<p>The secrecy deceived the public, deceived the committee
of Congress, and even deceived President Eisenhower. His
comments over the period of months showed that his subordinates
had misled or deliberately deceived him on the key
point in the controversy—the role of Adolphe Wenzell. In this
respect the secrecy possible under “executive privilege”
worked against the best interests of President Eisenhower.
Apparently his subordinates thought they could distort the
record, and keep it hidden from the public and the President.
Only the persistent work of Senator Kefauver’s investigators
pulled loose sufficient facts to document the deception.</p>

<p>President Eisenhower might have been able to sell the
Dixon-Yates contract to the public if it had been handled as a
simple debate of private power versus public power. But he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
could no longer see it through once he had been forced to
take note of a “conflict of interest” that he had previously
denied existed.</p>

<p>Cancellation of the Dixon-Yates contract did not end the
Eisenhower administration’s problem with that ill-fated venture.
It was to be a major factor in 1959 in blocking the nomination
of Lewis L. Strauss as Secretary of Commerce.</p>

<p>In November of 1955, William Mitchell, counsel for the
Atomic Energy Commission, made a report stating: “It appears
that Wenzell, while having a conflicting private interest,
acted as one of the principal advisers of the government”
in the negotiating of the Dixon-Yates contract. Mitchell
called attention to the many meetings in which Wenzell had
taken part as a government official in the first four months of
1954.</p>

<p>“The matters on which Wenzell was advising the contractor
[Dixon-Yates] were the same on which he had been employed
to advise the government,” Mitchell stated officially
for the AEC.</p>

<p>When the government canceled the contract on grounds
of a “conflict of interest,” the Dixon-Yates group claimed that
tremendous expenditures had already been made on the contract.
When Dixon and Yates sued the government for $3,534,788,
the Justice Department was forced to go to court
with legal briefs and facts to support the government contention
that Wenzell’s role was a “conflict of interests.”</p>

<p>Thus Attorney General Brownell’s department was in
court to give evidence of an impropriety that President Eisenhower
had said did not exist.</p>

<p>Less than a year later, on August 11, 1956, Senator Estes
Kefauver and Senator Joseph O’Mahoney, the Wyoming
Democrat, insisted on action against those engaged in concealing
the facts.</p>

<p>Senator Kefauver charged that Sherman Adams and other
“high officials of the Eisenhower administration” violated the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
criminal law in their handling of the Dixon-Yates contract.
He named the other high officials as Lewis L. Strauss, chairman
of the Atomic Energy Commission and the President’s
adviser on atomic energy matters; Rowland R. Hughes,
former Director of the Budget; and J. Sinclair Armstrong,
chairman of the SEC.</p>

<p>In asking Attorney General Herbert Brownell to present
the matter to a federal grand jury, Kefauver commented:</p>

<p>“Indictments and convictions have been obtained under
Section 371 of Title 18 of the United States Code in cases
involving similar circumstances. The offense under this section
of the Criminal Code is that of conspiring to defraud the
United States Government. The essential ingredient of the
offense under this section of the Criminal Code is the failure
of a government official to discharge conscientiously the
duties of his office and administer Federal law in an unbiased
manner.”</p>

<p>Kefauver continued: “In this case there exists substantial
evidence indicating that Mr. Adams, Mr. Hughes and Mr.
Strauss deliberately attempted to conceal the conflict of interest
growing out of Mr. Wenzell’s dual role in the Dixon-Yates
deal—a conflict which the President’s own Attorney
General now labels so contrary to public policy as to render
the agreement null and void.”</p>

<p>Senator O’Mahoney characterized the Dixon-Yates matter
as violating “every concept of decent government and fair
and impartial administration of applicable law.”</p>

<p>The stentorian-toned Wyoming Senator gave a “partial
listing of the wreckage left strewn in the path” of Dixon-Yates!</p>

<p>1. “The independent character of the Atomic Energy Commission
and the Tennessee Valley Authority was brought into
serious question.</p>

<p>2. “Officials of the Department of Justice and the Securities
and Exchange Commission were placed in the position<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
of having been persuaded to take legal positions which ran
counter to precedent of many years standing.</p>

<p>3. “The administration of the law by SEC was brought
into disrepute because of SEC’s flagrant departures from accepted
interpretations of the Public Utility Holding Company
Act and its succumbing to pressures from ‘higher
authority’ emanating from the White House.</p>

<p>4. “AEC was forced to execute and sponsor a contract
which the Department of Justice has since asserted violated
the Holding Company Act, the Atomic Energy Act, and the
conflict of interest statutes.”</p>

<p>O’Mahoney said that there “is no way that we can ascertain
the full facts” because “the Subcommittee has been
completely blocked from getting to the bottom of the Dixon-Yates
contract by the very men in the White House who
were involved in these negotiations.”</p>

<p>After this debacle, it surprised me more than ever to discover
that few people saw the full evil of the broad principle
of “executive privilege” as set out in the May 17, 1954, letter.</p>

<p>There was still a general lack of awareness of the possible
dictatorial power lurking behind the secrecy curtain.</p>

<p>As I have said, I did not believe that President Eisenhower
would knowingly use secrecy to cover crimes, but I had
doubts about some people in his administration. Even if it
could be assumed that every member of his administration
was totally honest, “executive privilege” was still too potentially
dangerous a doctrine to have in force.</p>

<p>It was not until January 9, 1961, that the Supreme Court
of the United States stated the final words on the Dixon-Yates
contract. Chief Justice Warren delivered the opinion
of the Court that Adolphe H. Wenzell had been involved in
a “conflict of interest” which was a violation of the law (18
U.S.C. 434).</p>

<p>The law states: “Whoever, being an officer, agent or member
of, or directly or indirectly interested in the pecuniary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
profits or contracts of any corporation ... is employed or
acts as an officer or agent of the United States for the transaction
of business with such business entity, shall be fined
not more than $2,000 or imprisoned not more than two years,
or both.”</p>

<p>No criminal charge was brought against Wenzell, but the
majority opinion stated that the civil law suit by the Dixon-Yates
group involved “fundamental questions relating to the
standards of conduct which should govern those who represent
the Government in its business dealings.</p>

<p>“The question is whether the Government may disaffirm
a contract which is infected by an illegal contract,” the majority
opinion stated. “As we have indicated, the public policy
embodied in Section 434 requires nonenforcement [of the
Dixon-Yates contract] and this is true even though the conflict
of interest was caused or condoned by high government
officials.”</p>

<p>The Eisenhower administration, as I have already stated,
could probably have made a winning argument for the
Dixon-Yates contract in a debate involving simply public
power versus private power. However, the temptation to use
the secrecy of “executive privilege” proved too great, and
ironically the secrecy kept President Eisenhower in the dark
about the details of the role of Adolphe H. Wenzell until it
was too late. Excessive secrecy blinded President Eisenhower
and some of his assistants until they were so victimized by
deceit that they could not recover their equilibrium and
salvage the Dixon-Yates contract.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII<br>
<span class="fs150">Congress Becomes Concerned</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">In late 1954 and early 1955, secrecy obscured the facts in a
major controversy over administration of the government
loyalty-security program. The Republicans had campaigned
in 1952 on a charge that the Truman administration was
“soft” on Communists and contended that an administration
headed by Adlai Stevenson could be expected to be composed
of many Communist “coddlers.” In the 1954 congressional
election campaigns the Republicans used statistics
compiled by the Eisenhower administration to continue to
assert that Democrats were “soft” on Communists.</p>

<p>The Democrats contended that the Eisenhower administration
was engaged in a vicious “numbers game” to pad the
statistics and make it appear that Republicans were tougher
about firing Communists or Communist sympathizers. The
Democrats claimed that many loyal government officials
were being arbitrarily forced to resign to build the numbers
against the Democrats.</p>

<p>When the Democrats won the 1954 election—and thus
captured control of the congressional committees, they were
eager to investigate and document the Democratic contention
that the communists-in-government issue was “phony.”
Democratic committee members asked for records that they
believed would prove their case, but they ran into a thick
wall of secrecy.</p>

<p>The extreme campaign oratory and pledges had inflamed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
the issue, and it was difficult to get it into perspective. Here
was no doubt of laxity in the administration of the security
programs by some agencies, and the conviction of Alger Hiss
on a perjury charge had made it appear to some Republicans
that they were fully justified in charging that the Democrats
as a whole were “soft” on Communists. Hiss had certainly
held a key role in the State Department under the Democratic
administrations, prior to exposure of his communist
connections by the House Un-American Activities Committee
in 1948.</p>

<p>Most Republican political figures took a fairly balanced
view of the communists-in-government issue. They regarded
the administration of loyalty-security programs as a difficult
problem for any political party. They saw the need for some
personnel changes and a little tighter administration of
loyalty-security matters.</p>

<p>But the Republican party also harbored a few overeager,
inexperienced, and a few downright malicious men who
tackled the job of personnel security with a wild, free-swinging
vigor and little real judgment. There was a little evidence
in 1953 and 1954 of Republican mismanagement of some
security cases. However, no real tangible evidence surfaced
until January 1955, when Senator Olin D. Johnston, the
South Carolina Democrat, and his Committee Staff Director
H. William Brawley started an investigation of the security
program. Johnston was chairman of the Senate Post Office
and Civil Service Committee with jurisdiction over government
personnel policies.</p>

<p>The investigation had barely started when the Eisenhower
administration sought to hide the bungling and incompetence
by claiming “executive privilege.” By the time the
hearings had been concluded in the following fall, the secrecy
wall of “executive privilege” had been used by the
State Department, the Agriculture Department, the Civil
Service Commission, and the White House. A conspiracy of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
silence hampered the investigation from start to finish, but
I had obtained enough information on one celebrated security
case to demonstrate the kinds of mistakes and mismanagement
generally involved.</p>

<p>In December 1954 and January 1955, I had written a series
of articles describing the Agriculture Department’s unjustified
ruling on Wolf Ladejinsky. Ladejinsky, an agricultural
attaché in Tokyo, was called a “security risk” by Agriculture
Secretary Ezra Taft Benson without the slightest evidence
that Ladejinsky’s loyalty was questionable. The State Department
had previously cleared Ladejinsky following an
exhaustive investigation under the new and tighter security
standards established by the Eisenhower administration.</p>

<p>I had been able to verify that the Agriculture Department
made its adverse ruling on the same evidence that had been
examined by the State Department when it cleared Ladejinsky.
Harold Stassen, then head of the Foreign Operations
Administration, moved in quickly to clear Ladejinsky. His
report on Ladejinsky’s file stated that there was no evidence
that Ladejinsky had ever been sympathetic to any communist
causes in the nineteen years he had been employed as
an economist by the government.</p>

<p>Even with FOA and State on record clearing Ladejinsky,
it took more than six months of congressional investigation
to force Agriculture Secretary Benson to withdraw his finding
that Ladejinsky was a “security risk.” Throughout the
entire period of time, the investigating subcommittee was
obstructed by the refusal of various agencies to submit reports
and give testimony.</p>

<p>Philip Young, chairman of the Civil Service Commission,
refused to comply with a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">subpoena duces tecum</i>, for production
of records. He cited the May 17, 1954, letter on
“executive privilege” and commented:</p>

<p>“The President’s letter points out that it is essential to efficient
and effective administration that
<ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;original text: employes">employees</ins> of the executive
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
branch be in a position to be completely candid in
advising each other on official matters, and that it is not in
the public interest that any of our conversations or communications
or any documents or reproductions concerning such
advice be disclosed....”</p>

<p>R. W. Scott McLeod, who then headed the State Department
personnel security program, refused to tell the investigating
subcommittee of his conversations with Milan D.
Smith, executive assistant to Agriculture Secretary Benson.
He claimed that to tell what he told Smith on the Ladejinsky
case would reveal advice within the executive branch of the
government, and would violate President Eisenhower’s instructions
on “executive privilege.”</p>

<p>The report of the subcommittee of the Senate Post Office
and Civil Service Committee released on July 22, 1956, devoted
an entire section to the problem of obtaining information
from the executive branch in the face of the arbitrary
secrecy policies being used under a claim of “executive
privilege.”</p>

<p>“At the outset and throughout the period of its existence
the subcommittee and staff have been handicapped in their
work by the refusal of the various executive agencies to submit
files, upon written request or by subpena, which files had
a bearing upon the operation of the Government employees’
security program, the very subject designated to the subcommittee
to investigate,” the official subcommittee report
stated.</p>

<p>“Must the Congress set up its own investigational staff
with undercover men in various agencies so as to know what
goes on?” the subcommittee asked.</p>

<p>The report continued: “The legislative function cannot be
carried on in the dark. The Supreme Court has approved the
comment of Woodrow Wilson who said:</p>

<p>“‘It is the proper duty of a representative body to look
diligently into every affair of Government and to talk much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
about what it sees. It is meant to be the eyes and the voice
and to embody the wisdom and will of its constituents. Unless
the Congress have and use every means of acquainting
itself with the acts and the disposition of the administrative
agents of the Government, the country must be helpless to
learn how it is being served; and unless Congress both scrutinize
these things and sift them by every form of discussion,
the country must remain in embarrassing, crippling ignorance
of the very affairs which it is most important that it
should understand and direct.’”</p>

<p>The Johnston subcommittee declared that the interpretation
being placed on the President’s May 17, 1954, letter was
such “as to force the Congress to legislate in a vacuum. Each
department or agency head is the arbiter of what he should
disclose, and in some instances disclosures were made when
they reflected a credit on the department or agency or discredit
on a committee witness.”</p>

<p>Once again officials had testified freely on matters that
made the political party or agency look good, but refused to
produce records that might embarrass them.</p>

<p>The report cited the classic legal treatise, <em>Wigmore on Evidence</em>.
In this work Professor Wigmore denies that the Chief
Executive or any other officer has a testimonial privilege not
to be a witness in court.</p>

<p>“The public (in the words of Lord Hardwicke) has a right
to every man’s evidence,” Professor Wigmore wrote. “Is there
any reason why this right should suffer an exemption when
the desired knowledge is in the possession of a person occupying
at the moment the office of the Chief Executive of a
State?</p>

<p>“There is no reason at all. His temporary duties as an official
cannot override his permanent and fundamental duty
as a citizen and as a debtor to justice. The general principle
... of testimonial duty to disclose Knowledge needed in
judicial investigations is of universal force. It does not suffer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
an exception which would be irrespective of the nature of
the person’s Knowledge and would rest wholly in the nature
of the person’s occupation....</p>

<p>“Let it be understood then, that there is no exemption for
officials as such, or for the Executive as such, from the universal
testimonial duty to give evidence in judicial investigations.
The exemptions that exist are defined by other
principles.”</p>

<p>The Johnston subcommittee report also made note of the
act of the First Congress establishing the Treasury Department.
This law made it the duty of the Secretary of the
Treasury to “report and give information to either branch
of the Legislature, in person or in writing (as may be required)
respecting all matters referred to him by the Senate
or House of Representatives, or which shall appertain to his
office....”</p>

<p>The subcommittee did not contend that it could force the
President or cabinet officers to testify on any subject, but it
did contend that cabinet officers must testify when there is a
specific statute covering their responsibility.</p>

<p>Attention was called to the Supreme Court ruling in the
famous case of <em>McGrain v. Daugherty</em>, handed down in 1927
in connection with the Senate investigation of the Teapot
Dome scandals. The opinion written by Justice Van Devanter
stated:</p>

<p>“We are of the opinion that the power of inquiry—with
process to enforce it—is an essential and appropriate auxiliary
to the legislative function.... A legislative body
cannot legislate wisely or effectively in the absence of information
respecting the conditions which the legislation is
intended to affect or change; and where the legislative body
does not itself possess the requisite information—which not
infrequently is true—recourse must be had to others who do
possess it.... Thus there is ample warrant for thinking, as
we do, that the constitutional provisions which commit the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
legislative function to the two Houses are intended to include
this attribute to the end that the function may be effectively
exercised.”</p>

<p>According to the best authorities it seemed clear that Congress
had the power to compel testimony when searching for
facts within its jurisdiction. The Supreme Court had held
that private persons could be compelled to testify, and it
seemed equally clear that government officials could be compelled
to give evidence. There was no way for Congress to
force the President personally to give testimony or produce
records except by impeaching him. Yet he was obligated,
along with all other government officials, to give testimony
or produce records for a proper congressional committee as
long as the national security was not endangered.</p>

<p>Certainly the revelation of testimony of conversations between
a State Department personnel officer and an Agriculture
Department personnel officer on the Wolf Ladejinsky
case would not endanger the national security of the United
States. It is significant that the Department of Agriculture
departed from precedent in previous security cases in making
information on Ladejinsky available, but this was information
derogatory to Ladejinsky. The Department used secrecy
to hide its own faulty administration. The claim of “executive
privilege” was simply being used to cover up, and everyone
familiar with the record knew it.</p>

<p class="no-indent">By the spring of 1955, enough executive agencies were refusing
records to Congress that Representative William
Dawson, the Illinois Democrat who served as chairman of
the House Government Operations Committee, had become
concerned.</p>

<p>On June 9, 1955, Representative Dawson wrote to Representative
John E. Moss, the young California Democrat,
formally establishing a Government Information Subcommittee
and asking that Moss be chairman. Congressman
Moss was only in his second term in Congress, and normally
would not have been assigned chairmanship of a subcommittee
unless it appeared relatively unimportant as a vehicle
for publicity.</p>

<p>“Charges have been made that Government agencies have
denied or withheld pertinent and timely information to the
newspapers, to radio, and television broadcasters, magazines,
and other communication media, to trained and qualified
research experts and to the Congress,” Congressman
Dawson wrote.</p>

<p>“An informed public makes the difference between mob
rule and democratic government. If the pertinent and necessary
information on governmental activities is denied the
public, the result is a weakening of the democratic process
and the ultimate atrophy of our form of government.”</p>

<p>Moss took the assignment immediately but waited five<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
months before starting what was to become the committee’s
five-year struggle with the Eisenhower administration.</p>

<p>Although the investigation ultimately became involved
almost exclusively in trying to break down the barrier of
“executive privilege,” it started out on general information
policy problems. At the time of the first hearing (November
5, 1955) there was only a handful of observers greatly
concerned over “executive privilege.” James S. Pope, executive
editor of the Louisville <cite>Courier-Journal</cite>, J. Russell Wiggins,
executive editor of the Washington <cite>Post and Times
Herald</cite>, and Harold L. Cross, special counsel for the American
Society of Newspaper Editors, were among those who
shared my worry.</p>

<p>James (Scotty) Reston, Washington correspondent for
The New York <cite>Times</cite>, had recently expressed concern over
“managed news.” He objected to “the conscious effort” to
give news emanating from the Geneva Conference “an optimistic”
flavor.</p>

<p>“After the Geneva smiling, the new word went out that it
might be a good idea now to frown a little bit, so the President
made a speech at Philadelphia, taking quite a different
light about the Geneva Conference,” Reston said. “That
is what I mean by managing the news.”</p>

<p>I didn’t like “managed news” any better than Reston, but
I believed that the arbitrary secrecy of “executive privilege”
was the core of the problem. There would be “managed
news” as long as executive departments and independent
regulatory agencies were able to invoke an arbitrary secrecy
to prevent the press and Congress from reviewing the record—and
as long as newspapers indolently accepted the
management.</p>

<p>The Moss subcommittee gave me an excellent chance to
state my views the first day of its hearings. I began my
testimony with a review of the history of the May 17, 1954,
letter and the Army-McCarthy hearings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span></p>

<p>“Since that time,” I stated, “seventeen departments of the
Government have used this letter as a precedent for withholding
actual decisions of the government. Conversations
and documents used in arriving at decisions are regarded as
confidential, and the Congress and reporters alike are denied
information.”</p>

<p>I pointed out that the American Civil Liberties Union had
filed a complaint against the use of “executive privilege” by
subordinates of executive agencies. And I commented that
it was startling to find Senator McCarthy and the American
Civil Liberties Union together on an issue.</p>

<p>“I think this demonstrates that this is not something political,”
I said. “The party in power may gain some kind of a
temporary advantage from hiding the record, but in a long-time
advantage, for both parties, it is best to try to make a
full disclosure of what goes on in government.”</p>

<p>In answer to questions I said I did not object to specific
legislation to cover areas of government where secrecy was
essential. I emphasized that “if the record of the government
must be confidential, it is not too much to ask the executive
department to give a reason. Democrats and Republicans in
Congress have an equal interest in obtaining ... the whole
story, all of the information behind the decisions of the executive
agency.”</p>

<p>The next week, the Moss subcommittee on Government
Information began calling the long roll of witnesses from
the Post Office Department, the Agriculture Department,
the Treasury Department, and the Civil Service Commission.
The first task was to try to establish from reports and
testimony just what the information practices of each of these
departments were.</p>

<p>A few months of work revealed to Chairman Moss and his
staff a tendency toward “a flexible policy” in many departments.
A department might refuse to produce information on
one ground, and then jump to another reason when the first<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
became untenable. I knew that some press officials were
poorly schooled as to what should and should not be made
available, and that they made up the rules as they went
along. If the Moss subcommittee had done no more than establish
a written record on the laws and regulations being
used for information policies its effort would have been
worthwhile. Fortunately it did a lot more.</p>

<p>By the end of the first week of hearings the subcommittee
staff (Staff Director Samuel J. Archibald, Chief Counsel
Wallace J. Parks, and Special Counsel Jacob Scher) had
already gathered a large collection of rules and regulations
on information. Also, they had inserted in the record a copy
of a Joint Resolution, No. 342, passed by the House of Representatives
on May 13, 1948—a not-so-gentle reminder.</p>

<p>The Republican Eightieth Congress of 1948 had been so
irritated at the Truman administration for its refusal to make
records available to Congress that it passed a resolution
directing “all executive departments and agencies of the
Federal Government created by Congress” to furnish “such
information, books, records and memoranda” as was demanded
by a majority vote in any properly authorized committee
of Congress.</p>

<p>At the time of that dispute in 1948, such leading Democrats
as John W. McCormack, of Massachusetts, and
William L. Dawson, of Illinois, defended the Truman administration
for refusing to make available a Commerce Department
investigative report on Dr. Edward U. Condon,
director of the National Bureau of Standards.</p>

<p>President Truman had issued an executive order in which
he stated that “efficient and just administration of the employee
loyalty program ... requires that reports, records,
and files relative to the program be preserved in strict confidence.”</p>

<p>Even though this was a specific executive order, and limited
to investigative reports and personnel files, the Republicans<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
were outraged at being denied access to all information
on cases under investigation by Congress.</p>

<p>However, in 1955, when the tables had turned, the Republicans
used the same basic arguments the Democrats
used in 1948. The Republicans, moreover, were having to
defend a far more widespread withholding of records.</p>

<p>During this dispute, I examined the 1948 records of the
Senate on an investigation of a loyalty case involving William
Remington, another Commerce Department official.
William P. Rogers had been chief counsel for the committee
investigating the Remington case, and had been in charge of
preparing the Senate subcommittee report that castigated
the Truman administration for arbitrary and unjustified
secrecy in withholding personnel investigation files. In those
reports, Rogers had likened withholding information from
Congress to keeping the seeing-eye dog from a blind man.</p>

<p>This was the same William P. Rogers who was appointed
Deputy Attorney General in the first term of the Eisenhower
administration, and who later became the Attorney General
and the leading spokesman for the ultimate in “executive
privilege.”</p>

<p>In his early days in the Justice Department, I saw Bill
Rogers on a number of occasions and pointed out the inconsistency
of his positions. I asked him how he could be such
a caustic critic of secrecy in the Truman administration, and
then suddenly switch to being a leading advocate of such
total arbitrary secrecy as used by the Eisenhower administration
in its stretched claim of “executive privilege.”</p>

<p>“When you can show me that some crime or wrongdoing
is being covered up, come up and see me,” Rogers said.</p>

<p>I tried to reason with him, explaining that there were no
laws and no judicial decisions to support so absurd a claim
to an arbitrary right to withhold information. Rogers became
jocular and said I was taking the whole business too seriously.
He said that if there were serious cases he would examine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
them. He laughed off my suggestion that the cases then
available were serious and some day in the future could be
used as precedent to bury Democratic scandals from Republicans.</p>

<p>Rogers said that newspaper editorials had been in favor of
the May 17, 1954, letter when it was issued, and that there
was little support on my side. I stuck to my argument that
he was contradicting his own position of six or seven years
earlier. But it was no use to try to argue with him. I left
him to do his explaining later to the Moss subcommittee and
other congressional committees.</p>

<p>On May 8, 1956, the Moss subcommittee on Government
Information heard testimony from Bernard Schwartz, professor
of law and director of the Institute of Comparative
Law at New York University; Hugh Fulton, former chief
counsel for the Truman committee; and Harold L. Cross,
special counsel for the American Society of Newspaper
Editors.</p>

<p>Fulton, after an exhaustive statement on the problem of
arbitrary withholding by the executive agencies, concluded
that the efforts to impair the investigative power of Congress
“hampers the legislative powers and imperils democracy as
we know it.”</p>

<p>Harold Cross, who had been practicing law since 1912,
had also served for twenty-five years as a professor of newspaper
law in the Graduate School of Journalism, Columbia
University. I had known him for some years through work on
projects for the American Society of Newspaper Editors.</p>

<p>In his testimony, Cross struck at the legal basis of the
memorandum of Attorney General Herbert Brownell that
had accompanied the May 17, 1954, letter.</p>

<p>“Some of the findings of the memorandum ... are accurate,”
Cross said. [But] “the underlined part of the statement
is merely an assertion by the Attorney General. It is at direct
variance with pertinent court rulings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span></p>

<p>“These cases, and others, are cited to this subcommittee as
blanket authority for withholding information. They are
cited as establishing in Federal officials, subordinates as
well as heads, an inherent right to withhold information—not
only from the public and press and individual Congressmen,
but also from Congress itself and its committees. They
are cited as establishing rights to withhold that are final and
not subject to judicial review.</p>

<p>“Moreover,” Cross said, “these Attorney General opinions,
which cite no judicial authority, are inaccurate, are at direct
variance with pertinent court rulings.”</p>

<p>Cross concluded that Brownell’s “inaccurate” legal rulings
“are both cited and applied as if they were Holy Writ to suppress
information which this Congress needs in order to
legislate, which the press needs in order to perform its functions
and which citizens need in order to maintain a self-governing
society.”</p>

<p>It was inspiring to have such a clear statement and such an
exhaustive study from Harold Cross. He was highly respected
by the editors of the American Society of Newspaper
Editors, and I was certain that his logic would soon convince
many editors of the wisdom of a united opposition to the
unbridled claim of “executive privilege.”</p>

<p>Now came my first meeting with Bernard Schwartz, then
only thirty-three years old but already a recognized authority
in the fields of constitutional and administrative law. The
testimony of this short, dark-haired professor with the heavy
glasses was clear, well documented, restrained. His condemnation
of the May 17, 1954, letter was altogether
effective.</p>

<p>The letter claimed, Schwartz said, that the executive
agencies had “the absolute privilege and discretion” to withhold
information from Congress and the public.</p>

<p>“Those who assert that the law is settled in favor of an
unlimited right in the Executive ... do so out of an excess<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
of executive zeal but without any real basis in fact, or in
law for that matter.</p>

<p>“There is no statute or judicial decision which justifies the
extreme pretensions of privilege consistently maintained by
executive officials,” Schwartz said.</p>

<p>“It is true that there is a long history of executive refusals
to comply with congressional investigative demands and that
these refusals have often been justified, upon supposed legal
grounds, by opinions of the Attorney General,” he continued.
“Neither opinions of the Attorney General nor the
practice of the Executive can justify unwarranted distortions
of the Constitution.... Nor does a governmental practice
conceived in error become elevated to the plane of legality
merely because the error has been long persisted in.”</p>

<p>Schwartz called attention to arguments that Congress was
abusing its investigative power, and commented: “To this
writer, indeed, the overriding danger is not Congressional
abuse but the vesting of unfettered discretion in the Executive
to surround with secrecy all its activities.</p>

<p>“Those who are concerned with the possibility of legislative
abuse ignore the overriding peril of the present century,
that [of] the superstate with its omnipotent administration,
unrestrained by any checks on its all-pervasive regulatory
activities, so vividly pictured by George Orwell in his novel
<cite>1984</cite>.</p>

<p>“The great danger today is 1984, not Senator McCarthy. If
the elected representatives of the people assert their right to
lay bare all that goes on within the Executive, that danger
may be avoided. An Executive whose abuses and inadequacies
are exposed to the public eye can hardly become a
menace to constitutional government.”</p>

<p>There had never been any doubt in my mind about the
basic problems involved in the executive claim of an unlimited
right to withhold information. But it was comforting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
to be supported by the exhaustive legal studies of Fulton,
Cross, and Schwartz.</p>

<p>This was only the start of an interesting association with
Professor Schwartz, who later became a headline figure as a
result of his controversial investigation of the independent
regulatory agencies.</p>

</div>

<p class="no-indent">While the Moss investigations continued, the Senate Permanent
Investigating Subcommittee was accumulating
evidence that showed how a relaxation of government controls
over shipments of vital and strategic materials had
resulted in a sharply increased flow of these materials to the
Soviet-bloc countries. In February 1956, Chairman John L.
McClellan, the Arkansas Democrat, opened public hearings
on the relaxation of controls over East-West trade.</p>

<p>McClellan announced that his staff—headed by Chief
Counsel Robert F. Kennedy and Investigator LaVern Duffy—had
discovered “evidence that merchants of the free world
are helping to build up Russia’s military potential by furnishing
it items which are indispensable in constructing or maintaining
a war machine.”</p>

<p>In August 1954, representatives of the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization nations, plus Japan, had met in Paris
in a Coordinating Committee known as COCOM. This committee
had downgraded, or otherwise decontrolled, approximately
150 out of 450 strategic items. Items removed from the
embargo list included heavy metal-working machinery,
electric power generating equipment, minerals, metals, transportation
equipment, and petroleum products and equipment.</p>

<p>“Such downgrading and removal [from embargo lists] has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
been harmful to the security of the non-Communist world,”
Chairman McClellan said.</p>

<p>Chief Counsel Kennedy tried to push into the U.S. Government
agencies to find out how this relaxation had taken
place, and to pin down the responsibility for the action.
Excuses of security were given to refuse information, and
there were claims that testimony by U.S. officials might interfere
with our relations with our allies. When such excuses
failed to stand up, the blanket arbitrary secrecy of “executive
privilege” was invoked to hide disputes that had taken place
in government on the revision of the strategic materials list.</p>

<p>The committee was forced to rely on testimony from
persons no longer in government, or on tips from persons in
government who contacted investigators quietly because
they feared losing their jobs if they co-operated openly.</p>

<p>Thanks to such testimony, it soon became apparent who
had changed the strategic materials list to permit shipment
of copper, aluminum, precision boring machines, and huge
horizontal boring and drilling and milling machines to Iron
Curtain countries.</p>

<p>“The downgrading and decontrol of approximately 150 of
the items,” the McClellan subcommittee reported, “were
recommended by personnel in our own Government agencies
on the so-called Joint Operating Committees, contrary to
advice of the experts and technicians of the Defense Department
and in many instances against the advice of experts
in their own agencies.”</p>

<p>There were indications at an early stage of the investigations
that the revisions in the embargo list made the whole
strategic list a complete farce. Simple jig boring machines
were retained on the list as being prohibited from shipment
to a potential enemy. However, the revised list allowed the
shipment of more modern precision boring machines of much
higher strategic value.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span></p>

<p>Initially the Eisenhower administration policy was not
unified in barring access to testimony and records. But, as
the subcommittee intensified its investigation, the requests for
information ran into a stone wall of opposition from the executive
agencies involved—the State Department, Defense
Department, Commerce Department, and the Foreign Operations
Administration. No one claimed that defense secrets
were involved. The executive branch abandoned any pretense
and fell back on the arbitrary refusal by simply citing
President Eisenhower’s May 17, 1954, letter.</p>

<p>The arrogance of the executive branch was best demonstrated
by the letter from Secretary of Commerce Sinclair
Weeks to Commerce Department employees. He wrote:</p>

<p>“You are instructed not to testify either in public or executive
closed session with respect to any advice, recommendations,
discussions and communications within the executive
branch respecting any course of action in regard to East-West
trade control or as to any information regarding international
negotiation with the countries cooperating in East-West
trade controls....”</p>

<p>Weeks tried to give some color of law to the claim of executive
secrecy by citing three federal court cases, but the
subcommittee declared none of the cases cited involved the
right to withhold information from congressional committees.</p>

<p>It was Harold Stassen, then a Special Assistant to the
President, who balked at giving information in a manner that
most galled the subcommittee members.</p>

<p>“Are you willing to give us full, detailed, and complete
information?” Chairman McClellan asked Stassen.</p>

<p>Stassen replied: “I am willing to give you, and the executive
branch is willing to give you, every bit of information
that does not violate one of three considerations: One,
security from the standpoint of intelligence; two, the rule on
internal executive branch documents ...; three, the details<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
of international negotiations which would make our relations
with our allies more difficult.”</p>

<p>“Are you willing to give us the list of items that were decontrolled
or downgraded?”</p>

<p>“No, I do not have ... those lists now.”</p>

<p>“All right,” McClellan said. “Let me ask you: Are you
permitted to testify under the security cloak that is wrapped
around Government officials in this matter?”</p>

<p>Stassen declared that McClellan was helping the Communists
in revealing material on the strategic materials list.</p>

<p>“You say I am helping the Communists,” McClellan
snapped. “The allies, whose position you are defending,
Great Britain—I hope our strongest ally—publishes the list so
the Communists can see what she will sell, the very items
that are today classified from the Congress and the American
people.”</p>

<p>Stassen was surprised. “The United Kingdom does not publish
the international list, Mr. Chairman, that I know of.”</p>

<p>McClellan picked up some papers and extended them toward
Stassen. “Here it is; I hold it in my hand. This is a
Board of Trade <cite>Journal</cite>, October 16, 1954, on which wire,
copper wire, is excluded, so they know they can buy it.”</p>

<p>“Would you give it to me, please?” asked Stassen.</p>

<p>Even after Stassen was given the list published by the
British, he refused to make the almost identical American list
available to the McClellan subcommittee. After a long and
unsuccessful effort to obtain information from Stassen, Senator
Sam Ervin concluded that the Eisenhower administration
was willing to talk a lot but say nothing.</p>

<p>In his slow North Carolina drawl, the gray-haired Democrat
elaborated:</p>

<p>“We have had experience here that people in the lower
echelons of the executive departments have had their mouths
stopped, and we were told that those who were at the higher
levels could give us information. But I have come to this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
conclusion: That our position is sort of like that of one of
my clients, who came in my office one day and said that he
wanted to get a divorce from his wife.</p>

<p>“He admitted she was a good woman, a good mother, and
a good housekeeper. I said, ‘Well, what in the world do you
want to get a divorce from her for?’ He said, ‘Well, she just
talks, and talks, and talks, and talks, and talks all the time.’
I said, ‘What does she talk about?’ And he said, ‘Well, she
don’t say.’”</p>

<p>Stassen’s refusal to say anything was made all the more
appalling by the publication of <cite>The Inside Story</cite>, a book
about the Eisenhower administration written by Robert J.
Donovan of the New York <cite>Herald Tribune</cite>.</p>

<p>“The contents of the book,” the McClellan subcommittee
stated, “are based upon documents, materials, minutes, and
other information similar in nature and character to that
which this subcommittee has been trying to obtain in the
course of discharging its legislative duties and responsibilities.</p>

<p>“The executive branches of the Government have been
adamant in refusing to make such information available to
this subcommittee, and it is difficult to reconcile such attitude
with its willingness to give similar information to private
individuals.”</p>

<p>The McClellan subcommittee was not critical of Donovan,
but the members were infuriated by the policy inconsistencies.
A request was made for Maxwell Rabb, Cabinet
Secretary, to appear and explain the reasons and circumstances
surrounding the release of information to Donovan.</p>

<p>“Rabb failed and refused to appear,” the subcommittee
reported. “Thereafter, a letter was sent to Under Secretary
of State [Herbert] Hoover [Jr.], Secretary of Commerce [Sinclair]
Weeks, ICA Director [John B.] Hollister, Assistant Secretary
of Defense Gordon Gray, calling attention to the fact
that material of a confidential nature and relating to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
internal workings of the government at Cabinet and staff
levels had been disclosed to a private individual for a commercial
purpose, and in the light of these facts, the chairman
of the subcommittee again requested that the documents
of the Joint Operating Committee, relating to decontrol of
strategic materials, be made available to this subcommittee
as early as possible.”</p>

<p>The information was not supplied, and the McClellan subcommittee
declared that this “suppression of information
raises not only the question as to the right of Congress to
know, but also the question of the right of the public in a
democracy to be informed as to the activities of its government.”</p>

<p>In its reports, the McClellan subcommittee declared that
the doctrine of separation of powers as explained in President
Eisenhower’s May 17, 1954, letter was totally wrong
in asserting the complete independence of the executive
branch. The subcommittee quoted from the opinion of Chief
Justice William Howard Taft in the Grossman case in which
he said:</p>

<p>“Complete independence and separation between the
three branches, however, are not attained or intended, as
other provisions of the Constitution and the normal operation
of government under it easily demonstrate.” The Grossman
case set out the various checks the executive, legislative,
and judicial departments are specifically granted under the
Constitution.</p>

<p>The subcommittee legal report stated flatly that there are
no legal cases upholding the claimed “inherent right to withhold
information” from Congress.</p>

<p>In another report, the subcommittee also challenged the
broad use of the May 17, 1954, letter from Eisenhower to
Defense Secretary Wilson. The report quoted from the May
17, 1954, letter:</p>

<p>“You will instruct employees of your Department that in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
all their appearances before the subcommittee of the Senate
Committee on Government Operation regarding the inquiry
now before it [Army-McCarthy hearings] they are not to
testify....”</p>

<p>“It is clear that this letter was intended to apply specifically
to the Army-McCarthy hearings,” the subcommittee
report concluded, but the fact was that it had “been cited
by twenty or more federal agencies and departments as
grounds for refusing information to Congress.”</p>

<p>Chairman McClellan went on the Senate floor to express
his concern over the total secrecy that was being clamped
on the executive branch.</p>

<p>“The Government agencies acting in concert are doing
everything to hinder and hamper the Subcommittee’s efforts
to ascertain the facts concerning the relaxation of these
controls,” the Senator declared. “Except for some co-operation
from the Department of Defense, the information has
not been forthcoming. The facts the Subcommittee has developed
thus far ... have not been made available or furnished
... by the executive agencies.</p>

<p>“The information we have has been secured from documents
and publications of foreign governments, where the
information is being freely given out by our allies. That same
information in the United States is being withheld by the
executive branch of our Government from both the Congress
and the American people.”</p>

<p>McClellan declared it is “a farce” how the Battle Act list
of strategic materials is withheld from Congress and the
people of the United States but is available to the Communist-bloc
countries. “They know what they can buy,” he
said. “They [the Communist bloc countries] know what they
do buy and have bought.</p>

<p>“Can it be ... this classification, this policy of secrecy,
this suppression or withholding of the truth is a process or
an action designed for hiding of errors, inefficiency and bad<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
judgment of Government officials?” he asked. “I am convinced
it is. If not, then why not give the Congress the information
and let the American people know the truth?”</p>

<p>Senator Richard Russell, the veteran Georgia Democrat,
joined McClellan in denouncing the arbitrary secrecy in
the East-West trade investigations. He said it presented “a
very shocking picture of the failure of co-operation with the
Congress in a field in which we have as direct a responsibility
or a greater responsibility than the executive department in
attempting to maintain a superiority in arms, in order that
we may defend our country.”</p>

<p>Senator Wayne Morse, the Oregon Democrat, also lashed
out at the secrecy, and declared that such hiding of government
records would justify voting against the whole foreign-aid
program.</p>

<p>“We have a right to know what goods foreign-aid countries
ship to Russia,” Morse said. “We are not asking for the disclosure
of secrets which involve the war plans of our country,
[and] which should be kept secret.”</p>

<p>Senator Joseph R. McCarthy and Senator Morse were
rarely together on an issue. But on the question of secrecy
in the Eisenhower administration, Senator McCarthy lined
up with Morse, McClellan, Russell, and such liberals as
Senator Paul Douglas (Dem., Ill.) and Senator Thomas
Hennings (Dem., Mo.).</p>

<p>“I was extremely critical of the Democrat administration
for withholding information from Congress,” McCarthy said
in a Senate speech. “During the hearings which the very
able Senator from Arkansas has been conducting, I was
appalled by the even greater secrecy maintained by the
executive branch today. As the years go by the Executive is
becoming more and more arrogant and highhanded toward
legitimate congressional requests for information.”</p>

<p>By this time I was starting to feel optimistic about breaking
the secrecy barrier, for it seemed that political figures of all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
complexions were aroused about the danger it created for a
democratic government. Additionally, at this time there came
a report, dated May 3, 1956, from the House Government
Operations Committee, parent of the Moss subcommittee. It
stated that the Eisenhower administration’s claim to an inherent
right to secrecy “has never been upheld by the courts.
It has been a mere Executive <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ipse dixit</i> [say so].”</p>

<p>The five-point conclusion of this report seemed to me to be
as fine a résumé of the legal situation as I had seen:</p>

<p>“1. Refusals by the President and heads of departments
to furnish information to the Congress are not constitutional
law. They represent a mere naked claim of privilege. The
judiciary has never specifically ruled on the direct problem
involved in a refusal by Federal agencies to furnish information
to the Congress.</p>

<p>“2. As far as access to information is concerned the courts
have not distinguished basically between executive agencies
and quasi-legislative or quasi-judicial agencies. Both appear
to stand in the same status.</p>

<p>“3. Judicial precedent shows that even the President has
been held to be subject to the power of subpena of the courts.
While this is so, it may be that the only recourse against the
President himself is impeachment if he fails to comply with a
subpena of either the courts or the Congress.</p>

<p>“4. Any possible presidential immunity from the enforcement
of legal process does not extend to the heads of departments
and other Federal agencies. Judicial opinions have
never recognized any inherent right in the heads of Federal
agencies to withhold information from the courts. The courts
have stated that even where the head of the department or
agency bases his action on statutory authority the courts
will judge the reasonableness of the action in the same light
as any other claim of privilege. The courts have held that the
mere claim of privilege is not enough.</p>

<p>“5. There is no inherent right on the part of heads of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
departments or other Federal agencies to withhold information
from the Congress any more than they have a right to
withhold information from the Judiciary....”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Before the McClellan subcommittee on the Senate side
completed its report, a number of voices had been raised in
defense of the Eisenhower administration’s secrecy. But
they did not seem to be strong voices. Only Senator Karl
E. Mundt, the South Dakota Republican, and George H.
Bender, the Ohio Republican, signed a minority report on
the East-West trade investigation.</p>

<p>Senator Mundt and Senator Bender charged that the report
of the five-member majority “is entirely misleading as to the
effectiveness of international control of strategic materials.”
Although Chairman McClellan had consistently indicated
a willingness to take testimony or records in a closed session
if a problem of real national security was involved, Mundt
and Bender defended the Eisenhower administration’s refusal
to make information available on grounds that to testify
might help the Communists.</p>

<p>“To make some of this information available in public
session would tell the Communist nations about our strategic
and short supply, reason for control and decontrol,” the
Mundt-Bender report stated. “We would publicize for the
benefit of potential enemies the thoughts, recommendations,
advice and working papers of subordinates who worked for
those in the executive branch who held and exercised action
responsibility.”</p>

<p>In years past, Senator Mundt had been highly critical of
the secrecy of the Truman administration. Now, however, he
said he wished to “disassociate myself from that conclusion”
by Senator McClellan that secrecy is being used to cover
up “errors, inefficiency and bad judgment.”</p>

<p>“I think at the moment it is purely a political deduction,”
Senator Mundt said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span></p>

<p>Hardly anyone took Senator Bender’s position seriously for
he was generally regarded as a political buffoon. To discredit
his support of the Eisenhower administration’s secrecy,
the majority report merely quoted from two speeches that
Bender had made as a House member in October 1951.</p>

<p>In October 1951, when the shoe had been on the other
foot, Bender rose on two occasions to castigate the Truman
administration for a censorship of government information.</p>

<p>“Power over the press,” he said, “is the path to dictatorship.”</p>

<p>And:</p>

<p>“What most of us find the most objectionable in the President’s
[Truman’s] order is the ease with which it can be used
to cover up blunders and incompetence, and the absence
of any provision for removing secrecy provisions after the
emergency has passed. We may now find our friends in other
countries revealing information which we are not permitted
to publish or broadcast.”</p>

<p>Bender’s last sentence could not have been more prophetic.
The majority report hammered home the prophecy-come-true:
“The British have published substantially the same
export-control list as that which our Government departments
and agencies seek to hide and conceal from the American
people.”</p>

<p>On the basis of consistency, reason, and logic the Eisenhower
administration’s broad use of “executive privilege”
was by now thoroughly discredited. I did not see how President
Eisenhower or anyone else could defend it, but I had
not taken into account President Eisenhower’s lack of understanding
of just what was taking place under the cover of
“executive privilege.” The President was exceedingly popular,
and there were plenty of people who were willing to use
his good name and reputation for honesty as a cover for
their own errors, incompetence, misjudgments, or improprieties.</p>

<span class="fs150">Pressing a Point with Ike</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">The final reports from the four congressional investigations—a
House Government Operations Committee, the Senate
Dixon-Yates investigating subcommittee, the McClellan
subcommittee on East-West trade, and the Wolf Ladejinsky
probe—were all released during the summer of 1956. Each
assailed the excessive arbitrary secrecy that had hampered
the investigations.</p>

<p>So, once again, at a press conference on September 27,
1956, I raised the problem of arbitrary executive secrecy
with President Eisenhower.</p>

<p>“Mr. President,” I said. “At least four Congressional committees
in a period of the last few weeks have issued reports
that were critical of what they termed excessive secrecy
which they felt covered up mismanagement in the operation
of the Government.</p>

<p>“Now, these committees contend that there is no court
decision backing the broad proposition of executive secrecy,
and I wondered if you could tell us if you feel that all employees
of the Federal Government, at their own discretion,
can determine whether they will testify or will not testify
before committees when there is no security problem involved?”</p>

<p>The President’s answer indicated that he was still not
aware of the scope of the problem.</p>

<p>“Well, I believe that the instructions are clear, that when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
there is no question of security, national security, involved,
that everybody is supposed to testify freely before congressional
committees. I will have to look up the regulations, I
mean the letters of instruction that have gone out. Primarily,
I think this is a function of the department heads and the
separate office heads—”</p>

<p>“Well, Mr. President—” I tried to break in to correct him,
but he continued.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe that any individual who happens to be,
let’s say from a filing clerk on up can by themselves decide
what is right for them to tell and what is not right.”</p>

<p>“Mr. President,” I explained. “They used the May 17, 1954,
letter that you wrote to Secretary Wilson in the Army-McCarthy
hearings as a precedent in this particular case. I
wonder if you felt they were misusing it if they use it, say, a
clerk or an assistant secretary?”</p>

<p>The President was mildly irked at being pressed to comment
on a specific situation. “Now, you give me a very long
and involved and detailed question here at a place where
I don’t even remember what I wrote to Secretary Wilson at
that time. I will have to look it up. If you will put your
question ... in to Mr. Hagerty so we can look it up, why, it
will be answered.”</p>

<p>I was amazed that the President didn’t have a better grasp
of the problem at this late date. Dozens of government
officials had been using his name and his letter to Wilson as
a justification for refusing to produce records in a number
of cases which had been headline news, but he couldn’t
remember what his policy was.</p>

<p>On leaving the press conference, I returned to the National
Press Building and prepared my question for submission
to Jim Hagerty. I drafted the question with care so
there could be no confusion as to the points at issue, and
delivered it to Hagerty at the White House. The letter
follows.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Mr. President: At least four congressional committees
have issued reports recently criticizing the executive
agencies for what they term “excessive secrecy” that can
cover up mismanagement.</p>

<p>These committees contend that there are no court decisions
to support the broad contention of the “confidential
executive business” as set forth in your May 17, 1954,
letter to Secretary Wilson in the Army-McCarthy hearings.</p>

<p>The committees do not quarrel with your personal right
to declare specific acts or communications as “confidential.”
They do argue that many subordinate officials are
wrongfully using the May 17, 1954, letter to claim that
their government actions and communications are “confidential.”</p>

<p>Some agencies have stated that Congress is entitled to
“only final decisions” of the agency, and has no right of
access to papers leading up to the decisions.</p>

<p>Do you feel that all employees of the Executive Branch
have the discretion to testify or not testify before Congress
about their official acts, when no security is involved?</p>

<p>At what level does this discretion lodge?</p>

<p>If you feel this is a misuse of the precedent, would you
clarify this matter on the access to information by the
Congress and the press?</p>
</div>

<p>I knew the question would be answered by Gerald D. Morgan,
the White House counsel, and I made several trips to
the White House to convince him of the wisdom of limiting
the use of “executive privilege” to cases approved specifically
by the President.</p>

<p>Morgan seemed to be convinced at that stage that the
Eisenhower administration should put some bridle on the
unrestrained use of “executive privilege” by officials at all
levels. I argued that it was to the advantage of the administration
in power to have the congressional committees actively<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
policing the agencies, and that there was grave danger
of corruption developing in any agency where those in
charge felt they could arbitrarily block congressional investigators.</p>

<p>Morgan asked that I send him a memorandum on the
proper safeguards against improper use of “executive privilege.”
I felt optimistic when I submitted the memorandum to
Morgan October 4, 1956, and felt that perhaps the Eisenhower
administration was willing to take action publicly to
end this arbitrary secrecy.</p>

<p>I had mentioned to Morgan that I had read the article he
had written for the California <cite>Law Review</cite> of December
1949, in which he spoke forcefully in support of the power
of Congress to compel testimony and production of records.</p>

<p>Morgan’s article, entitled “Congressional Investigations
and Judicial Review,” was written when he was an assistant
legislative counsel to the House of Representatives. In those
years he had been a critic of the Truman administration for
excessive secrecy and a strong advocate of the power of
Congress to investigate.</p>

<p>In his law review article, Morgan pulled apart the Supreme
Court decision in <em>Kilbourn v. Thompson</em>, a case decided
in 1881. For years this case had cast some doubt on
the rights of the Congress to conduct broad investigations
to carry out its legislative function. Morgan pointed out
that <em>Kilbourn v. Thompson</em> was a discredited decision, and
that the 1927 case of <em>McGrain v. Daugherty</em> upheld the right
of congressional committees to compel witnesses to testify
and produce records.</p>

<p>The case of <em>McGrain v. Daugherty</em> arose out of the Teapot
Dome scandal investigation of the 1920s. It was the same
case that was cited by various congressional committees in
1956 as authority for insisting on testimony and records from
government agencies.</p>

<p>The letter Gerald Morgan wrote me was not what I wanted,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
and it certainly was inconsistent with the principles he had
set forth in his 1949 law review article (see Appendix B).
But it did demonstrate some desire to come to grips with
the problem. He wrote:</p>

<p>“An employee is not free merely to exercise his own discretion
(with regard to testimony and production of documents),
but in the final analysis information will be withheld
only when the President or agency heads acting under the
President’s authority or instruction determine it is contrary
to the public interest to disclose it.”</p>

<p>Inasmuch as the letter suggested that information should
be given to committees of Congress unless there was a specific
order to the contrary from the President, Congressman
John Moss thought it portended an easing of the restrictions
on information. At least he hoped it did. How futile was
his hope we were soon to see.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the Congress had to rely to a large extent
on the Justice Department in normal moves to take court
action against any government officials who refused to give
testimony. So, although the case of <em>McGrain v. Daugherty</em>
upheld the right of Congress to demand testimony and
records, there was yet a practical problem involved. Congress
had to depend on the good faith of the Attorney General
and his top aides to enforce its demand.</p>

<p>A case in point occurred in the summer of 1956 when
the Justice Department used the secrecy of “executive privilege”
in an effort to block an investigation of a settlement of
an antitrust suit. The antitrust suit involved American Telephone
and Telegraph (A.T. &amp; T.), and the investigation was
being conducted by Representative Emanuel Celler’s antimonopoly
subcommittee of the House Judiciary Committee.
Chief Counsel Herbert Maletz was instructed by Celler to
obtain the Justice Department files to determine the facts
leading up to the settlement of the A.T. &amp; T. antitrust suit.</p>

<p>The suit had been initiated by the Department in 1949 for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
the purpose of forcing a divorce of A.T. &amp; T. and its subsidiary,
Western Electric. The separation was urged to break
the near monopoly that Western Electric enjoyed in the
production of telephone equipment.</p>

<p>The suit had been hailed by Attorney General Herbert
Brownell as a great victory for the government, but he and
Deputy Attorney General William P. Rogers claimed “executive
privilege” and refused to make the files available. They
covered up the fact that the settlement allowing A.T. &amp; T.
to continue the ties with Western Electric was made over
the opposition of staff members in the Justice Department.</p>

<p>Although Herbert Maletz was blocked from examining the
files of the Justice Department, he managed to obtain much
of the information he sought from the files of A.T. &amp; T. and
from records in the Defense Department. This outside probe
uncovered some interesting things that Justice Department
secrecy had hidden. It showed that a high official of A.T. &amp; T.
had written a letter which Defense Secretary Charles E.
Wilson sent to the Justice Department urging settlement of
the antitrust suit on terms favorable to A.T. &amp; T. The investigation
also revealed the conversations between Attorney
General Brownell and a lawyer for A.T. &amp; T. that paved the
way to settlement.</p>

<p>Because “executive privilege” blocked the Celler subcommittee
from questioning Justice Department employees, it
was necessary to subpoena a former official of the Justice
Department to establish that Brownell’s settlement was actually
opposed by the working staff in the Antitrust Division.
But who could override Brownell, the President’s chief legal
adviser? The investigation stopped at the door of his office.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The Celler antimonopoly subcommittee of the House Judiciary
Committee ran into “executive privilege” again when
it started to investigate the operations of the Business Advisory
Committee (BAC) and the Department of Commerce.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span></p>

<p>Chairman Celler, an aggressive New York Democrat, was
concerned over the way the BAC was influencing policy in
the Department of Commerce. He questioned whether there
were adequate safeguards against the misuse of such a committee.
Without the safeguards, it could become a device
for getting competitors together for price fixing or other
violations of the antitrust laws.</p>

<p>Chief Counsel Maletz, under directions from Celler, asked
for the minutes of the meetings of the BAC and the details
of the operations. The subcommittee requests were rejected
by Commerce Secretary Sinclair Weeks on grounds that the
BAC minutes were “confidential” business of the executive
branch of government.</p>

<p>Chairman Celler then argued that the BAC was a private
committee, not supported by government funds and not a
government agency. He denied that any “executive privilege”
existed and declared that if it did exist, Secretary Weeks
could not use it properly to try to cover up the activities of a
private group that happened to give some advice to a department
of government.</p>

<p>Commerce Secretary Weeks replied that BAC was a government
committee, and that the minutes of BAC meetings
therefore were covered by an “executive privilege.”</p>

<p>Presumably the Celler antimonopoly subcommittee would
have been allowed access to the minutes of the BAC if
Weeks had considered it a private business group. But in
order to put those minutes out of the reach of congressional
inquiry Secretary Weeks was forced to the ludicrous position
of claiming that the private group became a part of
the government (and therefore entitled to an “executive
privilege”) merely by advising it.</p>

<p>I had often used a quotation from Patrick Henry in talks
on secrecy, but it had never been more appropriate than now.
Said Henry:</p>

<p>“To cover with the veil of secrecy the common routine of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
business, is an abomination in the eyes of every intelligent
man and every friend to his country.”</p>

<p>I was reminded also of these telling words of Edward
Livingston:</p>

<p>“No nation ever yet found any inconvenience from too
close an inspection into the conduct of its officers. But many
have been brought to ruin, and reduced to slavery, by suffering
gradual imposition and abuses which were imperceptible
only because the means of publicity had not been secured.”</p>

<p>One could only wonder when President Eisenhower would
awaken to the abuses of secrecy being perpetrated in his
name, right under his own nose.</p>

<span class="fs150">Keeping the Professor in the Dark</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">The Justice Department, Commerce Department, Agriculture
Department, Defense Department, and State Department
had all used the arbitrary secrecy of “executive
privilege” without causing a public uproar. Not only had
they succeeded in avoiding major press criticism, but they
had secured statements from President Eisenhower to give a
noble and patriotic coloring to their deceptions.</p>

<p>With such encouragement at the top it was inevitable that
the policy of secrecy would spread. In August 1957, the newly
created House Legislative Oversight Subcommittee hired
Bernard Schwartz, the young law professor from New York
(see Chapter VIII), as counsel for an investigation of the
various regulatory agencies. The committee, headed by Representative
Morgan Moulder, Missouri Democrat, had been
established “to go into the administration of the laws [creating
the regulatory agencies] and see whether or not the
laws ... were being carried out or whether they were being
repealed or revamped by those who administer them.”</p>

<p>The young professor had barely started his work in September
1957, when he began bumping into secrecy trouble.
In all, there were six of the so-called “independent regulatory
agencies” in the scope of the House Legislative Oversight
Subcommittee. The “big six” to be probed were the
Federal Communications Commission (FCC), the Civil
Aeronautics Board (CAB), the Interstate Commerce Commission<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
(ICC), the Federal Power Commission (FPC),
the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), and the Securities
and Exchange Commission (SEC).</p>

<p>The Congress had created these regulatory agencies to
perform a wide range of functions including control of radio
and television licenses, control of gas and electric power
lines, control of commercial land transportation by train,
truck, or bus, the investment market, and air transportation.
Rights worth billions of dollars were involved in the decisions
of these agencies, and it had been the stated intention
of Congress to remove these decisions from the direct pressure
of politics. To do this, the regulatory agencies were
headed by bipartisan commissions or boards, the members
of which were nominated by the President, subject to
approval by the Senate and limited to a fixed term of office.</p>

<p>In theory, at least, these boards or commissions were
specialized courts in their fields. They had rule-making and
administrative functions, but they also rendered judicial
decisions on the basis of public records and public hearings.
Once appointed, these members of the regulatory agencies
were to be insulated from the pressure politics of the White
House and the Congress. Prior to Dr. Schwartz’s arrival in
Washington, there had been widespread reports, and some
evidence, that members of some of the regulatory commissions
were engaging in conversations with political personnel
at the White House and elsewhere on cases under study. To
Dr. Schwartz, an outstanding authority in the field of administrative
law, it was elementary that such conversations
were improper while a case was being decided.</p>

<p>“It is as bad as having one of the parties in a law suit
sneak into the chambers of the judge to try to influence his
decision in the middle of a trial,” Dr. Schwartz told me.</p>

<p>I discussed some incidents with him which I felt merited
investigation, and he told me he was having trouble getting
access to material he requested. The CAB appeared ready to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
try to pull down a secrecy curtain as broad as “executive
privilege” because it could have no legal substance for an
independent regulatory agency.</p>

<p>On September 19, Dr. Schwartz requested that the CAB
allow members of the House subcommittee staff “to receive
and examine any records, documents, or information
directly, or indirectly, pertaining to your agency, function
or business within the jurisdiction of this subcommittee.”</p>

<p>A few days later, on September 23, he pressed CAB Chairman
James R. Durfee for full access to CAB records. Durfee
insisted the CAB would screen all files containing documents
or communications from other agencies or departments of
government. It was now apparent that Durfee was going to
refuse access to internal governmental communications on
grounds of “executive privilege.” Dr. Schwartz was irate. He
termed Chairman Durfee’s position “completely ridiculous”
and suggested that Durfee obtain competent legal counsel.</p>

<p>By this time the pressure of the investigation was being
felt by a number of the regulatory agencies. The chairmen
of the six regulatory agencies met at a luncheon at the
University Club in Washington the next week to determine
how to handle the inquisitive Dr. Schwartz. Because of the
success some government departments had been having with
“executive privilege” some of the chairmen decided that this
was to be the answer for their agencies, but there was no
general agreement.</p>

<p>Dr. Schwartz was not discouraged by the lack of information;
he only pressed harder. Subcommittee Chairman Morgan
Moulder took the suggestion of Dr. Schwartz and set
October 17 as a public hearing date for CAB. In the meantime,
on October 5, he followed another Schwartz suggestion
and asked that the CAB prepare and submit a report
on “all gifts, honorariums, loans, fees, or other payments” of
things of value received by CAB employees from any “person,
firms, corporation, association, organization, or group<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
having any interest, direct or indirect,” in any matter before
the board.</p>

<p>Dr. Schwartz was allowed to examine the public files, but
his efforts to obtain files of correspondence with the White
House and with other agencies ran into the claim of “executive
privilege.” In the first months, he nevertheless became
aware that Sherman Adams and others on the White House
staff had been extremely active in reaching various regulatory
agencies.</p>

<p>In an exhaustive eighty-two-page “Memorandum of Law,”
filed on October 17, Dr. Schwartz exposed the true nature
of the “executive privilege” arguments. They all sprang from
the idea that “the King can do no wrong.”</p>

<p>“In the pretension of those who espouse ‘executive privilege,’”
he said, “the infallibility recognized in the King in the
days when he was personally sovereign of England has been
attributed to the President in our system. The reasoning
which supports the doctrine should shock the intelligence,
as well as the sense of justice, of those who truly believe in
the essentials of representative democracy.”</p>

<p>He reported that the CAB claimed “the authority to screen
files and records before they are made available to the subcommittee,
with a right to the Board in its discretion to remove
any and all documents” that could be considered
personal files of Board members or communications within
CAB or with the White House.</p>

<p>“The Civil Aeronautics Board cannot claim privilege with
regard to communication between the Board, on the one
hand, and the President or other departments and agencies,
on the other. Such an assertion of privilege cannot defeat
the right of this subcommittee to investigate the relationship
between the independent regulatory agencies and the executive
branch.”</p>

<p>Schwartz continued: “‘Executive privilege’ is not available
to an independent agency like the Civil Aeronautics<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
Board as a possible basis for the withholding of information
from the Congress. The Civil Aeronautics Board, as the
Supreme Court has recognized, is an independent agency
whose members are not subject to the removal power of the
President. Such a body cannot in any proper sense be characterized
as an arm or an eye of the Executive. It is instead
an arm of the Congress, wholly responsible to that body.</p>

<p>“The doctrine of absolute ‘executive privilege’ itself is not
supported in law. The cases cited by its proponents are not
truly relevant on the power of the Executive to withhold
information from the Congress. On the other hand, there are
many decisions squarely rejecting the doctrine, even in courtroom
cases. In addition, Dean Wigmore (the leading authority
on the subject in this country) flatly repudiates the
doctrine.”</p>

<p>Although Dr. Schwartz did succeed in eliciting half-promises
of co-operation from some officials of the regulatory
agencies, most of them dragged their feet. Richard A. Mack,
a member of the FCC, wouldn’t show investigators many of
his records, including the office diary that provided links
for his indictment later on charges of having conspired to
violate the federal law. The lack of co-operation by Commissioner
Mack was matched by the resistance at CAB,
where Schwartz was trying to pin down evidence of contacts
by Sherman Adams.</p>

<p>In January 1958—after five months of frustration—Schwartz
insisted that the members of the Legislative Oversight Subcommittee
get tough and demand full co-operation. Some
members of the investigating committee did not want to
force the issue. Several of the Republicans came out flatly
in support of the Eisenhower administration’s obstructionist
tactics.</p>

<p>The lack of support from committee members so irritated
Schwartz that it took only a little urging from some newsmen
to get him to leak a staff memorandum to The New York<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
<cite>Times</cite>. It was a lengthy document setting out the well-settled
legal principle that it is improper for members of regulatory
agencies to have private talks with litigants when a case is
in hearing or in the process of being decided. The Schwartz
memorandum also questioned the propriety of the members’
accepting lavish entertainment from executives of the industries
they were supposed to regulate.</p>

<p>Tempers flared in the days following the leak of the
Schwartz memorandum, and finally on February 10, 1958,
the House subcommittee voted to fire Dr. Schwartz. I called
Dr. Schwartz in the early evening of February 10 to inform
him of the subcommittee’s decision and also to tell him that
a subpoena was to be issued for him to testify the next
morning.</p>

<p>He told me he had copies of every important document
from the committee files in a trunk and two cardboard boxes.
“Someone should have knowledge of what is in these records,”
he said, “so it will be possible to force the subcommittee to
continue hearings.” If something dramatic wasn’t done, he
was convinced the investigation would never get off the
ground.</p>

<p>Dr. Schwartz asked if I wanted the copies of documents
to take to members of Congress who had shown an interest
in the problems of the regulatory agencies. I said I should
not take possession of documents which might be considered
the property of the House subcommittee. But since the documents
were legally in his custody, I suggested that he could
take them to the apartment of Senator John J. Williams, the
Delaware Republican, and I would be happy to accompany
him.</p>

<p>I had talked with Senator Williams of improper pressure
on the regulatory agencies and thought he would take the
records. He had fought against tax scandals in the Truman
administration, but I regarded him as an objective crusader
who would call the strikes the same way if the Eisenhower<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>
administration were involved in wrongdoing. I had hoped
that Senator Williams might be able to give the investigation
of regulatory agencies the same prodding that he had given
to the House tax scandals investigations in 1951 and 1952.</p>

<p>Dr. Schwartz said he would be willing to turn the papers
over to Senator Williams and explain them to him in detail.</p>

<p>I headed at once for his apartment. When I arrived, Dr.
Schwartz had the trunk and two boxes of documents ready
to go. Mrs. Schwartz was nervous about her husband’s
going, however. I assured her that for practical political
reasons it was unlikely that the House would take action
against Dr. Schwartz for delivering the documents to a
United States Senator. As quickly as possible we carried the
heavy trunk and boxes to my car. At the Mayflower Hotel,
we hired a porter to wheel them on a baggage cart to the
apartment of Senator Williams. While we were at the Williams
apartment, Dr. Schwartz received an urgent telephone
call from his wife. He took it in private in another room.
Mrs. Schwartz said she had been called by a reporter who
told her that since Senator Williams was a Republican, he
would probably turn the documents over to Sherman Adams
at the White House. The fear was groundless, but Mrs.
Schwartz was frantic and made her husband promise to
leave the Williams apartment and take the documents with
him.</p>

<p>Dr. Schwartz returned to the room and told the Senator it
had been suggested that the documents might be taken to
Senator Wayne Morse, the Oregon Democrat. We excused
ourselves to go telephone Senator Morse and left Senator
Williams alone with the documents. I made the call. As I
was certain he would—for I had previously talked with him
about the regulatory agency scandals—Morse assured me he
was interested in reviewing any documents Schwartz had
available.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span></p>

<p>When we arrived at his apartment, Senator Morse greeted
us calmly and assured us that he wanted the documents because
of his official interest in the regulatory agencies, and
we left them with him. Now we felt certain we had created a
situation in which it would be virtually impossible for the
House to avoid going forward with the investigation. The
word would move fast that the files had been examined by a
leading Democratic Senator and a leading Republican Senator.
It would create a good many complex problems for any
House members inclined to ignore or hide the evidence and
leads that Schwartz had accumulated.</p>

<p>Before the Schwartz files were returned to the House subcommittee,
Senator Morse read them. It was reported to me
that most, if not all, of the documents were photographed
before they were sent on to Representative Oren Harris,
the Arkansas Democrat who was chairman of the House
Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce.</p>

<p>Until now it appeared Sherman Adams had erected a total
shield from investigations by Congress. He had used “executive
privilege” to avoid testimony in the Dixon-Yates case.
He had been able to make his contacts at the Securities
and Exchange Commission without undergoing questioning
by the investigating subcommittee which was examining why
the SEC had postponed a hearing on Dixon-Yates at a
crucial point.</p>

<p>It was Sherman Adams who scribbled his initials on papers
to indicate he had approved them for President Eisenhower’s
signature. Sherman Adams was on the telephone daily to
United States senators and congressmen on knotty legislative
and patronage matters. Sherman Adams ironed out the
problems between cabinet officers, and he dipped his hand
into virtually every department from the first months of the
Eisenhower administration. Always it was understood that
Sherman Adams was speaking for President Eisenhower, or
was acting for President Eisenhower. Even when he didn’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
say, “This is what the President wants,” it was understood he
was speaking for President Eisenhower.</p>

<p>The legend grew that Sherman Adams was cold and clean
as New Hampshire granite—a barrier against the corrupting
influence of personal and political favoritism. Coming on the
heels of the Truman administration, such a reputation was
much admired even when it was known that Adams was not
well liked. There were countless stories of his undiplomatic,
even rude, treatment of Republican political figures who were
interested in a return to some good plain political patronage.
It all added to the legend that Sherman Adams was one of
the finest influences the Eisenhower administration had
brought to Washington.</p>

<p>But there were also those stories of the calls that Sherman
Adams made on members of the so-called “independent
regulatory agencies.” One might commend the White House
for keeping a firm hand on agencies directly under the
control of the White House, but the regulatory agencies were
another matter. Politics were supposed to be kept out.</p>

<p>Shortly after the midnight ride with Dr. Schwartz, I came
into the possession of copies of two letters from “Sherm”
Adams to “Murray” Chotiner, an attorney for North American
Airlines. In the letters, “Sherm” had informed “Murray”
that he had discussed the North American Airlines case with
the acting head of the CAB. It appeared to be a one-party
contact with an official of the CAB during the period when
a case was being decided. It appeared to be a direct violation
of the rules of the CAB if Adams had done what he stated in
the letter he had done for Chotiner, a politically influential
California lawyer. I wrote my story on the facts available
in the secret files of the House subcommittee.</p>

<p>I caught President Eisenhower’s eye early in the February
26, 1958, press conference and he recognized me with a
trace of reluctance.</p>

<p>“Mr. President,” I started. “Sherman Adams has written<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
a letter in which he states that he went over the details of a
pending Civil Aeronautics Board matter with an acting chairman
of the CAB.</p>

<p>“It is contended up on Capitol Hill, that this was a violation
of a CAB rule which states—it is improper that there
be any communication, private communication that is, by
any private or public person with a member of the CAB,
with the examiners of the CAB, with the staff while the case
is pending, except in those matters prescribed by law.</p>

<p>“I wonder if you could tell us whether you felt Mr. Adams
was acting within the proper scope of his authority in this
particular matter.”</p>

<p>President Eisenhower pleaded ignorance of news stories
that had been on page one for days:</p>

<p>“Well, again you are bringing up a thing I have not heard
of; but I will say this: There is a number of cases that come
under the CAB that the White House must act on. Any
time that they refer or have anything to do with the foreign
routes that CAB has authorized, or refused to authorize,
then the President himself is required to make the final judgment.”</p>

<p>The President was confused. He was assuming that the
case was a foreign airline route case to which normal rules do
not apply. The case about which Adams had written the
letter, however, involved a domestic airline, North American
Airlines.</p>

<p>“And, very naturally,” President Eisenhower continued,
“my staff would want to get any additional information that
I need. So, I would assume it is so on that case.”</p>

<p>“Mr. President,” I broke in to explain that the North
American case was not a foreign line, but was a domestic
airline. “On that line—”</p>

<p>I was cut off by the President’s cold stare, and abrupt comment:
“I don’t want anything more about that.”</p>

<p>There was no opportunity to ask another question, but the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
record was much clearer to the nation’s editorial writers and
cartoonists than it was to President Eisenhower.</p>

<p>“Whether the President wants it or not, there ought to be
‘more about that’ at the very next news conference,” commented
the St. Louis <cite>Post Dispatch</cite> in a hard-hitting editorial.
The editorial pointed out that in the face of rules that would
make Adams’ contacts “improper,” President Eisenhower had
“not only evaded a direct question about whether Mr.
Adams’ intercession was improper but having evaded it, told
Reporter Mollenhoff: ‘I don’t want anything more about
that.’”</p>

<p>The Washington <cite>Post</cite> commented that President Eisenhower’s
answer “gave a damning indictment of his own unfamiliarity
with important national affairs yesterday in his
fuzzy comments on the relationship of Sherman Adams to
the Civil Aeronautics Board.</p>

<p>“For days there have been stories about the accusation by
Dr. Bernard Schwartz that Mr. Adams in 1953 discussed the
status of North American Airlines with the acting chairman
of the CAB on behalf of the airlines counsel, Murray
Chotiner. Yet Mr. Eisenhower said, almost incredibly, that
he had never heard of the matter.”</p>

<p>The <cite>Post</cite> editorial concluded:</p>

<p>“Is it that Mr. Eisenhower just isn’t interested, or is it that
Mr. Adams, who attempts to ease the Chief Executive’s
burdens, filters what the President reads?”</p>

<p>Reports were already circulating in Washington that
Sherman Adams had made some contacts at two other
regulatory agencies on behalf of Bernard Goldfine, a wealthy
New England industrialist. However, the claim of “executive
privilege” still spread its protective covering over Sherman
Adams and others at the White House. The officials
of the regulatory agencies continued to refuse to give testimony
on contacts with the White House. And, of course, at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
that stage Sherman Adams had no intention of giving public
testimony.</p>

<p>Then, suddenly, the House investigation became a hot
issue. Evidence was developed that Richard A. Mack, a
member of the FCC, had been involved in some rather complicated
financial dealings with a Miami attorney, Thurman
A. Whiteside. Whiteside had loaned him money, and there
was also an arrangement through an insurance firm which
was putting a little extra money in Mack’s pocket. Whiteside
checks totaling $2650 were received by Mack while he was
on the FCC, and Whiteside also gave him a one-sixth interest
in an insurance company that sold $20,000 worth of insurance
to one of the applicants in the FCC case involving
Miami Channel 10.</p>

<p>This case was to lead to the indictment of Mack and
Whiteside for alleged conspiracy to fix the award by FCC
on Miami Channel 10. Mack was forced to resign from the
FCC after a pathetic appearance before the House Legislative
Oversight Subcommittee.</p>

<p>In the criminal trial, Mack admitted receiving financial
help and “loans” from Whiteside, but contended that it
had nothing to do with the award of Channel 10 in Miami
to Public Service Television, Inc. Mack contended it was
merely an extension of the favors Whiteside had given him
since they were boyhood friends. The first trial ended in a
hung jury.</p>

<p>The former FCC member never went to trial again. In
court he was described as ill and alcoholic, and unable to
stand the ordeal of a trial.</p>

<p>Whiteside was tried a second time, and was acquitted on
the criminal charge. A short time later, in May 1961, Whiteside
was found dead in his Miami office. Death was caused by
a self-inflicted bullet wound.</p>

<p>The FCC in a later ruling ordered Public Service Television
to stop using Channel 10. The FCC had concluded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
that the activities of Mack, Whiteside, and others constituted
improper conduct in connection with the application of Public
Service Television.</p>

<p>The United States Court of Appeals upheld the FCC ruling
that Public Service and two other applicants had disqualified
themselves by improper practices. The Supreme Court refused
to hear an appeal.</p>

<p>Dr. Schwartz and his investigators had pinned down the
essential details on the Mack case before Schwartz was fired,
and the hearings demonstrated fully the type of activity that
at least one of the regulatory agencies had concealed with
the claim of “executive privilege.” By this time, it was clear to
everyone that there were a good many things wrong with the
operations of the “big six” regulatory agencies. There was no
proof that they were filled with corruption, but there was
adequate evidence of a widespread laxity that needed to be
examined and exposed.</p>

<p>There had been only the rumors of the Adams-Goldfine
relationship while Dr. Schwartz was with the House subcommittee,
but once the hearings on Mack were moving,
the whole subject of one-party contacts with regulatory
agencies came in for closer scrutiny.</p>

<p>Reports that Adams had received a vicuña coat and a
$2400 oriental rug from Goldfine evoked interest in Goldfine.
These reports were followed by the revelation that Goldfine
had lavishly entertained Adams at hotels in New York and
Boston, and during the same period of time Adams had made
inquiries for Goldfine at the SEC and FTC.</p>

<p>Sherman Adams whipped out a letter which he believed
would still the outcry against him. It was a vague letter that
simply admitted he had contacted the Federal Trade Commission
and the Securities and Exchange Commission on
some of Goldfine’s problems. However, Adams said he had
requested no favors for his friend Goldfine, but ignored the
fact that any call from Sherman Adams would flag a case for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
special attention. The benefits known to have been received
by Adams were small, but his relationship with the notorious
Goldfine was to become a source of continued embarrassment
to the White House. The embarrassment finally forced
Adams out of the White House into the open arena of congressional
questioners.</p>

<p>Adams went before the House Legislative Oversight Subcommittee
in the crowded House Caucus Room. It was his
first time to give testimony, and he hoped that it would stop
the criticism. President Eisenhower admitted that Adams
had been “imprudent” in his relationship with Goldfine. But,
the President said, “I need him.”</p>

<p>Now nothing could stop the criticism, public and private.
It seemed that every week brought more and more revelations
of the questionable activities of Bernard Goldfine.
There were charges of mislabeling of woolen goods filed by
the FTC, and records showed Goldfine firms involved in a
long series of mislabeling incidents. Goldfine had not filed
proper reports with the SEC for several years. Also, Goldfine
had refused to testify on a mysterious $700,000 in cashier’s
and treasurer’s checks he had taken out of his businesses.</p>

<p>Hailed before the committee, Goldfine took the Fifth
Amendment, claiming that to answer the questions might
tend to incriminate him. Every day that Bernard Goldfine
was on the witness stand or otherwise in the public eye
was pure misery for the Republican political party. It was
apparent that the Republicans would be saddled with Goldfine
as long as Sherman Adams remained the number one
assistant to President Eisenhower.</p>

<p>And so, on September 22, 1958, Sherman Adams resigned.
In a nationwide television broadcast, he said he had “done
no wrong” but was the victim of “a campaign of vilification.”</p>

<p>Only five days later, a federal grand jury in the District
of Columbia returned the indictment charging Richard
Mack, the former FCC commissioner, with conspiracy to defraud<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
the government. The indictment charged that Thurman
A. Whiteside, a Miami lawyer, had bought Mack’s vote
in connection with the award of Miami television Channel
10.</p>

<p>Some people paid a heavy price for what had once seemed
to them to be clever secretive manipulations to influence governmental
decisions. Whiteside crumpled under the strain
and died by his own hand. Mack cringed before the court
with a plea that he was too ill and too alcoholic to stand
trial.</p>

<p>Even a million-dollar fortune couldn’t save Bernard Goldfine
from the disgrace of a federal prison term. He hired the
most expensive lawyers and engaged in every conceivable
maneuver to stay out of prison, but in the end lost his freedom
and his “friends.” He went to prison on a criminal
charge of evading more than $800,000 in federal taxes. Although
he had boasted bravely that he would not co-operate
with the Justice Department in explaining what he did with
the missing $800,000, his health broke while in prison and
left him a shattered shell of his former self. Later the Internal
Revenue Service filed liens against his property totaling
more than $7,000,000. The Goldfine magic had turned
to mud.</p>

<p>These cases had dramatized the full evil of secret government.
The problems of Adams rose directly from the failure
of the White House to recognize the dangers involved. It
was not necessary to read evil intent into the origin of the
blanket secrecy. It was bad enough that the Administration
had so self-satisfiedly assumed that things were being handled
efficiently and properly and that the press and the Congress
were better off kept in the dark where they couldn’t
stir up trouble.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII<br>
<span class="fs150">Ike’s Lawyer and the Law</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">William Pierce Rogers was nominated to be United States
Attorney General in the fall of 1957. He had served as Deputy
Attorney General under Herbert Brownell from the time
the Eisenhower administration came to power in January
1953. When he was nominated for the top post, he was forty-five
years old and had been included by President Eisenhower
on a select list of bright young Republicans qualified
as presidential or vice presidential timber for 1960. He was
regarded as the closest friend of Vice President Richard
Nixon.</p>

<p>The Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on the Rogers
nomination had barely started on January 22, 1958, when
Senator Estes Kefauver raised the question of the Eisenhower
administration’s broad use of “executive privilege.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Rogers,” the Tennessee Senator said, “many of us in
the Senate and in the House have been increasingly alarmed
over the expansion of the pleading of privilege on information
which congressional committees desire, and feel they
have a right to have.”</p>

<p>Senator Kefauver explained the philosophy behind the
need for full information in a democracy, and then moved
to the specific problem:</p>

<p>“I think we all appreciate the fact that under the precedent
that when the President has matters up with his Cabinet
that he wants to withhold them from public inspection,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
he has that right; but we find here on numerous occasions
when the arms of Congress—the Securities and Exchange
Commission, the Federal Communications Commission, the
Civil Aeronautics Board, and various and sundry agencies
set up by the Congress to administer laws which our Congress
has the prime responsibility for administering—they,
themselves, are asserting the privilege and they are deciding
whether they want to withhold the information or not—things
the President does not even know anything about—so
that committees of Congress are being hampered in their
effort to get information.”</p>

<p>Senator Kefauver started to read from a report of the
House Government Operations Committee: “The most flagrant
abuse of the so-called legal authority is the misuse of
the May 17, 1954, letter from the President to the Secretary
of Defense at the time of the Army-McCarthy controversy....
It seems inconceivable that 19 Government departments
and agencies would cite this letter as a shadowy cloak of
authority to restrict or withhold information from the Congress
and the public. This flimsy pretext of so-called legal
authority only serves to demonstrate to what extent executive
departments and agencies will go to restrict or withhold
information.”</p>

<p>Senator Everett Dirksen, the Illinois Republican, interrupted
to emphasize that it was a House committee report
Senator Kefauver was reading, and that “I want to have that
clear.”</p>

<p>Senator Kefauver continued: “We had a case here [meaning
among Senate committees], where the head of the Securities
and Exchange Commission pled privilege to his
conversation with Sherman Adams, when apparently Mr.
Adams was trying to get a hearing postponed in a quasi-legislative
agency.</p>

<p>“We have a report by Senator Olin Johnston’s committee
in which they take great exception to the pleading of privilege<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
by Mr. [R. W. Scott] McLeod in the Ladejinsky case
with which you are familiar. We had the Al Sarena [mining
land grant] plea of privilege. We had some pleas of privilege
in connection with Mr. Gordon Gray when he was dealing
with rapid tax amortization, so it is getting to the point, Mr.
Rogers, where not the President but any of these agencies
... anybody who does not want any information to be made
public, just pleads privilege.”</p>

<p>Senator Dirksen intervened to volunteer comment “before
the Attorney General replies, because I was a part of the
proceeding on the McCarthy committee, and I was a part
of the proceeding involving the Chairman of the Securities
and Exchange Commission.”</p>

<p>“If it is all the same to Senator Dirksen, I had rather ask
my questions, and you may ask them in your time,” Kefauver
replied.</p>

<p>“I do not think there has been any great tendency [to secrecy]
in the last few years,” Rogers said. “I was counsel for
committees in ... 1947, 1948, and 1949 ... and I do not
believe that the problems are much different now and then.”</p>

<p>Then Rogers sought to postpone further discussion. “I
would like, I think maybe in the interest of time, to delay a
full discussion of this, because I have agreed with Senator
Hennings to appear before his committee to discuss this
whole matter.”</p>

<p>Senator Kefauver said he would be glad to see the
whole matter examined thoroughly by Senator Hennings,
but added: “I do think at this time on such an important
matter that you should give us some expression of your position,
or what your position will be.”</p>

<p>“On the general subject matter,” Rogers began, “I believe
in the value of congressional investigations.... I think they
have contributed a great deal to the success of our country,
and I think that the executive branch of the Government
has the responsibility to make the information available to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
congressional committees to the fullest extent that it is possible
to do so.</p>

<p>“On the other hand,” Rogers went on, “I think that the
history of the country has indicated that there are exceptions,
and that those exceptions have been recognized by
each administration throughout history. I do not think that
there is any reason why there should be much general disagreement,
and I think if we had a chance to discuss those
things in detail that probably our views would be pretty
much the same.”</p>

<p>Senator Kefauver asked Rogers about the use of “executive
privilege” by officials of the so-called independent regulatory
agencies.</p>

<p>“Well,” Rogers said, “I think that possibly there ought to
be an even greater attempt made to give all the information
to Congress possible, in those agencies.... I think you can
make mistakes of judgment if you generalize too much on
those things, and I think there has been a tendency to do
that.</p>

<p>“I remember debating the subject with Russ Wiggins ...
he and Mr. Clark Mollenhoff have been the leaders, and
when you get down to it there is not too much in the way of
fact. There has been a lot of general observation, but I would
like to come up, if you do not mind, and discuss this at length
with Senator Hennings’ subcommittee.”</p>

<p>I knew that Russ Wiggins was well informed on the specific
instances of arbitrary withholding. I had tried to discuss
a number of specific cases with Rogers but always found
him unavailable. Additionally, Senator Hennings had found
some difficulty in getting an agreement from Rogers to appear
before his Judiciary subcommittee.</p>

<p>“I had not quite understood from your last letter,” Senator
Hennings told the nominee, “that you were willing to appear
before the Constitutional Rights Subcommittee. You did<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
not say that you would not [appear], but I did not quite
understand you to say that you would.”</p>

<p>Rogers’ nomination was confirmed by the Senate, and by
the time he appeared before the Hennings subcommittee six
weeks later he had become the leading spokesman for the
ultimate in secrecy under the claim of “executive privilege.”
Rogers claimed that the executive branch of the government
could properly refuse to give Congress any document that
included any advice, recommendation, or conclusion. Although
the Constitution says nothing about such a right,
Rogers contended that the executive branch did have an
“inherent right” to refuse to give testimony or produce records.
He further contended that no law of Congress could
force production of such records.</p>

<p>This in essence was the position he presented to the Constitutional
Rights Subcommittee on March 6, 1958. In addition,
smiling, back-patting Bill Rogers now also claimed
that the so-called independent regulatory agencies—the
FCC, ICC, SEC, CAB, FTC, and FPC—could exercise “executive
privilege.” Such a position at the nomination hearing
might have created serious problems on his confirmation, for
at that time the House Legislative Oversight Subcommittee
was engaged in the probe of White House and political influence
on the regulatory agencies recounted in the foregoing
chapter.</p>

<p>At issue when Rogers testified on March 6 was the question
of whether the Congress should amend the “Housekeeping
Statute” (5 U.S.C. 22) by stating that this statute
covering custody of records could not be used as a justification
for withholding records from Congress or the public.
Rogers opposed the amendment but said that if it passed, it
still could not interfere with the broad right he claimed under
“executive privilege.”</p>

<p>When Representative George Meader, the Michigan Republican,
learned of the Rogers testimony he was enraged.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
Meader and Rogers had both served as counsel for Senate
investigating committees in the late 1940s, and Meader had
firsthand knowledge of the investigations that Rogers conducted
of the Truman administration. He also knew that
Rogers had been sharply critical of secrecy in the Truman
administration.</p>

<p>“Curious things seem to happen to individuals when they
move from one end of Pennsylvania Avenue to the other,”
said Representative Meader. He urged the Congress to
“strike down” Rogers’ claim with legislation declaring specifically
that records must be given to Congress. He referred
to the “executive privilege” as “nonexistent imagery” which
had no support in the Constitution, in the laws, or in the
decisions of the federal courts. Throwing aside all political
partisanship, Republican Meader told the House that if the
Rogers doctrine prevailed the executive will “become the
master, not the servant, of the people.”</p>

<p>Senator Thomas C. Hennings, whose subcommittee had
heard the Rogers testimony, was equally alarmed. A few
days after the hearings Hennings received a letter from Rogers
designed “to clarify” his testimony. On March 6, Rogers
had testified:</p>

<p>“Now I don’t recall any instance when Washington, Jefferson
or Truman or anyone else ever relied upon this [the
Housekeeping Statute] as a basis for ‘executive privilege’ for
withholding information. It is something entirely different.
This is a bookkeeping statute which says they keep the records,
they hold them physically. It doesn’t relate at all to
‘executive privilege’.”</p>

<p>While stating that the Housekeeping Statute included no
right to withhold information, Rogers in the same hearing admitted
that it had been erroneously used by officials who had
meant to use the “executive privilege” to keep government
records secret.</p>

<p>In a letter that followed his testimony, however, Rogers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>
completely reversed himself and stated that the Housekeeping
Statute is “a legislative expression and recognition of the
‘executive privilege’.”</p>

<p>Hennings replied that Rogers’ letter of explanation was
“incompatible” with his testimony. He said that Rogers’ letter
was not only “inconsistent” from a legal standpoint, but
“completely baffling when compared with his oral testimony.
In almost two years of investigations and study of the subject
of freedom of information,” Hennings continued, “I have
come across a number of cases where various misguided,
secrecy-minded executive department officials, eagerly seeking
authority to justify withholding information from the
Congress and the public have tortured the simple provisions
of the [law] ... beyond all recognition. This interpretation
now offered by the Attorney General in his letter surpasses
all of these others so far.”</p>

<p>On the specific point at issue, Chairman Hennings wrote
that he believed the Housekeeping Statute had no connection
with constitutional claims of “executive privilege.” “I am
amazed at the Attorney General’s assertion that it does. I
think the Attorney General’s letter presents overwhelming
proof of the urgent need to amend [the law] ... to make
clear beyond any doubt that Congress intended it to be
merely a housekeeping statute and not an instrument of
censorship.”</p>

<p>Rogers’ testimony had sent his critics scurrying to the records.
When he was chief counsel for a Senate subcommittee
investigating a loyalty case in the Truman administration,
Rogers had been balked by an executive order issued by
President Truman barring Congress from personnel files in
loyalty investigations. The records showed that Rogers had
fought against this secrecy, limited as it was. The committee
report, written under his direction, stated:</p>

<p>“Congress is entitled to know the facts giving rise to the
requests and to satisfy itself by firsthand information that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
the reasons are valid. Any other course blinds the legislative
branch and permits action only when the president provides
a ‘seeing-eye dog’ in the form of a request for legislation required
by the executive.</p>

<p>“If the subcommittee is denied the right to examine the
facts in specific cases where there appears to be a breakdown
in the loyalty program, it cannot make a complete appraisal
of the program.”</p>

<p>I had the switch in Rogers’ thinking very much in mind
when, less than a month after his appearance, the Hennings
subcommittee called me to testify as a representative of the
freedom of information committee of the national journalism
fraternity, Sigma Delta Chi. I told the subcommittee I opposed
any general legislation to allow officials to hide records,
and felt that in those areas where secrecy is needed it
could be covered by specific legislation.</p>

<p>“We have seen the proof year after year,” I testified, “that
the unlimited grant of the right to hide the record will lead
to abuse of power, corruption and mismanagement.</p>

<p>“Of course, the Attorney General tells us he does not believe
that secrecy is being used to hide errors or crimes in
the executive branch of Government. Mr. Rogers felt different
about this ten years ago. Then he was ... busy digging
out and exposing the crimes, favoritism, and errors
which he felt were being covered up by secrecy.... We
might say that Mr. Rogers was highly successful.”</p>

<p>I continued:</p>

<p>“Mr. Rogers may feel things are different today. However,
we can never trust the judgment of those in power who
might be inclined to make self-serving declarations on their
own virtues. This has happened often in the past. We know
now that at least eight or ten congressional committees have
made it clear they are not as sure as Mr. Rogers that secrecy
is not being used to hide crimes, favoritism, and blunders
today.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span></p>

<p>“It is not necessary to arrive at any conclusion on the
virtues of this administration or any administration, to conclude
that secret government is not in keeping with democracy.</p>

<p>“Even if we accept an administration’s declaration on the
many virtues it possesses, we must be guided by this principle:
‘Never trust a good man to make secret decisions for
you, if it would frighten you to lodge the same power in an
evil man or a man who is on the other side of the political
fence.’”</p>

<p>In the course of my testimony, Senator Roman Hruska,
the Nebraska Republican, sought to defend the Eisenhower
administration’s claim of “executive privilege” in the May 17,
1954, letter:</p>

<p>“He [President Eisenhower] directed that the Secretary
of the Army instruct his employees not to disclose information,
and the large segment of the American press at that
time hailed that decision as being something very fine and
very wise and very just.”</p>

<p>No one was going to get me to defend those uninformed
editorials that had been based on the belief that the May 17,
1954, letter was a single shot of secrecy aimed at Senator
McCarthy. I was on much firmer ground when the subject
switched to the case of <em>McGrain v. Daugherty</em> (1927) in
which the Supreme Court stated that the power to compel
witnesses to produce records and testify is a necessary part
of the legislative function.</p>

<p>“Under the Rogers doctrine, the Congress is reduced to a
third-rate division of Government,” I said. “Its investigations
can be limited to what officials in the executive branch of
the Government feel it is wise to produce. If the Government
has full discretion as to which facts will be made available
to the public, the press, or the Congress, then there is no
more than half freedom [to investigate].</p>

<p>“I do not want to be limited in my reporting to the self-serving<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
declaration from men like Richard A. Mack as to
what a fine job is being done at the Federal Communications
Commission.</p>

<p>“I do not want to be limited to the comments of T. Lamar
Caudle, Assistant Attorney General under the Truman administration,
as to what a fine job is being done in the prosecution
of tax-law violations.</p>

<p>“I do not want to be limited to the comments of Harold
Talbott, former Air Force Secretary, as to how he is handling
Air Force procurement.</p>

<p>“I do not want to be limited to the statements of former
Secretary of Interior Fall that the handling of Teapot Dome
oil reserves was really in the public interest.”</p>

<p>Also called to testify for Sigma Delta Chi was V. M. (Red)
Newton, the managing editor of the Tampa <cite>Tribune</cite>. Herbert
Brucker, editor of the Hartford <cite>Courant</cite>, testified on behalf
of the American Society of Newspaper Editors. And
Harold Cross, the able lawyer for the A.S.N.E., submitted a
legal analysis.</p>

<p>Nearly all newspaper, broadcasting, and legal organizations
favored the Moss-Hennings amendment to the Housekeeping
Statute. It passed Congress with ease despite
Administration opposition and on August 12, 1958, President
Eisenhower signed it.</p>

<p>The amendment to the Housekeeping Statute said simply:
“This section does not authorize the withholding of information
from the public or limiting the availability of records
to the public.” However, as he signed it into law, President
Eisenhower said: “It is not intended to, and indeed could not,
alter the existing power of the head of an executive department
to keep appropriate information or papers confidential
in the public interest. The power in the executive branch is
inherent under the Constitution.”</p>

<p>President Eisenhower had obviously accepted the Rogers
theory in full. He had accepted the misleading precedents<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
set out in a Justice Department memorandum in which it
was represented to him that George Washington had started
all this withholding from Congress. He had been convinced
by his subordinates that the “executive privilege” claims
made between 1954 and 1958 usurped no more authority
than George Washington had. And he had been convinced
by some of his advisers that he would be weakening the
presidency if he did not stand by the extreme “executive
privilege” doctrine.</p>

<p>Robert Donovan, in his book <cite>The Inside Story</cite>, related that
President Eisenhower “told the Cabinet he wanted it clearly
understood that he was never going to yield to the point
where he would become known as a President who had
practically crippled the Presidency.” This determination accounted
for President Eisenhower’s frequent use of the comment
that he was merely reiterating a principle used by
Presidents “back to the time of George Washington.”</p>

<p>The “historic precedents,” as I have indicated earlier, did
not stand up under close investigation. In an article for the
Federal Bar <cite>Journal</cite> of January 1959, J. Russell Wiggins, executive
editor of the Washington <cite>Post and Times Herald</cite>,
told how the historic background—as President Eisenhower
understood it—was first described. It appeared in the Federal
Bar <cite>Journal</cite> on April 1949, in an article by Herman Wolkinson,
a Justice Department lawyer. Wiggins pointed out that
an almost identical copy of the Wolkinson memorandum accompanied
the May 17, 1954, letter written by Eisenhower
to Defense Secretary Wilson. An expanded version of the
same material was used by Attorney General Rogers in testimony
before Congress.</p>

<p>Wolkinson’s article had stated:</p>

<p>“In the great conflicts which have arisen in the administrations
of Washington, Jackson, Tyler, Cleveland, Theodore
Roosevelt, and Herbert Hoover, the Executive has always
prevailed.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span></p>

<p>Wiggins’ painstaking research had convinced him quite
otherwise. “This contention is simply not supportable even
on the basis of the historical episodes to which Mr. Wolkinson
alludes and which the Department of Justice has incorporated
in its memorandum.”</p>

<p>Getting down to the specific episodes, Wiggins told how
Congress, in March 1792, had passed a resolution to initiate
an investigation of the disastrous expedition into Indian territory
by Major General St. Clair. The investigating committee
had asked for all records and papers dealing with the
expedition. President Washington did call a cabinet meeting
to discuss whether the papers should be given to Congress
but finally concluded “to make all the papers available” to
Congress. (See Chapter II.)</p>

<p>“If this case is precedent for anything,” wrote Wiggins, “it
is a precedent to show that the first President was in favor
of disclosure, as a principle of government, and as a constitutional
matter, except in some possible instances which
might later arise, but which in this affair did not exist.”</p>

<p>There was one time when President Washington did refuse
to send papers to the Hill. This was when the House of
Representatives asked him for the instructions and papers
furnished our ambassadors in negotiating the Jay treaty.
“But,” said Wiggins, “this no more sustains the claim to
sweeping powers of non-disclosure than the first episode.
Here, President George Washington refused the papers on
the sound and specific constitutional ground that the Senate
and not the House was entrusted with authority to advise
and consent on the making of treaties.”</p>

<p>After reviewing most of the so-called “withholding precedents”
used by Wolkinson and President Eisenhower, Wiggins
pointed out that President Jackson and President Tyler
had bitterly opposed giving papers to Congress but in the
end had forwarded all records requested.</p>

<p>Concluded Wiggins: “In most of Mr. Wolkinson’s examples,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
the Congress prevailed, and got precisely what it
sought to get.”</p>

<p>Because Senator Hennings and Congressmen Moss and
Meader had pushed through the amendment to the Housekeeping
Statute over Administration objections, they realized
that reliance upon “executive privilege” could now become
all the more stubborn and Congress would need to take
further action.</p>

<p>“In the minds of most people in this country, governmental
censorship probably is associated most closely with war or
dictatorship,” Chairman Hennings said. “Official suppression
of the truth generally is regarded as something alien to the
American tradition of freedom and incompatible with our
system of self-government. Yet, despite these national attitudes,
censorship and suppression of the truth are slowly
becoming more and more commonplace in our federal government,
and secrecy threatens to become the rule rather
than the exception.”</p>

<p>From the Republican side, the two Democrats were joined
by Congressman Meader. “The net effect of the Attorney
General’s statement,” said Meader, “is that the executive
branch of the Government will give to the Congress or its
committees such information as the executive branch chooses
to give and no more. I wonder if the American people and
their elected representatives in Congress appreciate the significance
of this ... pronouncement of the executive branch
of the Government.”</p>

<p>Meader declared that the Rogers doctrine “makes possible
a rigged, distorted, slanted” picture of what is going on in a
Government agency.</p>

<p>“The unlimited discretion in the executive branch of the
Government over access to information in its possession asserted
by the Attorney General, would vest in the departments
the power by ex parte presentations of half truths to
build a record which would permit only one conclusion.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span></p>

<p>In an analysis that filled six pages in the <cite>Congressional
Record</cite>, Meader pointed out that Rogers admitted there was
“no judicial precedent governing this question” of “executive
privilege.” “More study, not less, is required for intelligent
policy making in these days,” he pleaded. “This asserts
a doctrine of executive power which I believe is wholly out
of keeping with our concept of democracy and self-government.
It smacks of totalitarianism, and I hope it will never
prevail in this country.”</p>

<p>But the nonpartisan plea for reason and law made little
impression. The Eisenhower administration was smug in its
popularity. Leaders of Congress were too busy with political
chores to pay attention to any problem not connected with
the business of getting re-elected. The press could not or
would not think logically or consistently on the subject. Secrecy
that stood in the way of an individual reporter or newspaper
was deplored by that reporter or newspaper, but by
too few others. For the most part the attack on secrecy lacked
co-ordination, consistency, and enlightened concern.</p>

</div>

<p class="no-indent">Joseph Campbell had been treasurer and vice president of
Columbia University while General Dwight D. Eisenhower
was president of that institution. A pleasant and friendly
relationship developed between the two men, and General
Eisenhower was attracted by Campbell’s competency in accounting
and finance. After General Eisenhower was elected
President, he named Campbell a member of the Atomic
Energy Commission in 1953.</p>

<p>A year later President Eisenhower named Joseph Campbell
Comptroller General of the United States in charge of the
General Accounting Office (GAO). It is an important fifteen-year-term
office designed to serve the Congress as the
“financial watchdog” of all spending in the executive departments
and agencies. No single office in the United States is
more vital to the task of forcing the sprawling federal government
to administer the laws fairly and make expenditures
according to the laws.</p>

<p>The GAO was established in the Budgeting and Accounting
Act of 1921 as an arm of the legislative branch of government.
Once the Comptroller General has been appointed by
the President, he becomes an agent of the Congress. To assure
the independence of the office, the Congress established
the long term and provided that the incumbent could be
removed from office only by joint resolution of Congress or
by impeachment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span></p>

<p>The Budgeting and Accounting Act also gave the GAO
the power to examine all information and reports in order to
determine whether money was being spent in a legal manner.
The section on access to records states:</p>

<p>“All departments and establishments shall furnish to the
Comptroller General such information regarding the powers,
duties, activities, organization, financial transactions, and
methods of business of their respective offices as he may
from time to time require of them; and the Comptroller General,
or any of his assistants or employees, when duly authorized
by him, shall for the purpose of securing such
information, have access to and the right to examine any
books, documents, papers, or records of any such department
or establishment.”</p>

<p>The law allowed but one exception to the Comptroller
General’s legal right to demand and obtain access to “records
of any such department or establishment.” That one exception
gave the Secretary of State the power to determine
whether there should be a publication of expenditures of
funds used in dealings or treaty making with foreign nations.</p>

<p>The law should have been clear to anyone. The GAO
auditors were to be given access to all papers and all records
dealing with the expenditure of federal funds. It was the
only way they could carefully examine contracts and determine
whether any frauds or illegal procedures were involved.</p>

<p>But through the years, as might be expected in a bureaucracy,
some officials had been reluctant to put all the cards on
the table for the GAO. The reluctance increased in proportion
to the bungling, mismanagement, or fraud that might be
uncovered by prying GAO investigators.</p>

<p>In the first years of Joseph Campbell’s tenure as Comptroller
General, his office faced some of the normal bureaucratic
reluctance. But, on the whole, the holding back was
spotty. Usually the departments produced the records demanded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
when the inspection provisions of the Budgeting
and Accounting Act were pointed out to them.</p>

<p>By 1958, however, the use of “executive privilege” had
become so widespread that it was interfering with the work
of the GAO. The interference gradually came to light
through the work of an Armed Services subcommittee
headed by Representative F. Edward Hebert, the Louisiana
Democrat. Chairman Hebert had asked Comptroller General
Campbell to do a thorough study of the multibillion-dollar
Air Force ballistic missile program. He had also set
the GAO on the trail of a dozen other smaller projects where
it appeared that influence, favoritism, incompetence, or
fraud had cost the taxpayers millions of dollars in excess
costs.</p>

<p>To Chairman Hebert this unjustified secrecy was serious
business. For nearly ten years he had been engaged in important
investigations which had proved that the military
services could not be relied upon to police their own spending.
It was vital that there be an adequate policing job on a
Defense budget that totaled about 40 billion dollars a year—approximately
half of the entire federal budget. Year after
year, Chairman Hebert and Chief Counsel John Courtney
had conducted hearings showing incredible waste and inefficiency.
The staff of the Hebert subcommittee was small,
and Chairman Hebert was forced to rely on the GAO for the
major part of the auditing work and legal studies.</p>

<p>The Defense Department could not avail itself of the claim
of “national security” when the GAO auditors started an
investigation because the GAO auditors were cleared to
handle “Secret” and “Top Secret” classified material in the
same manner that Defense officials were. Lacking the “national
security” claim, the military services latched onto the
claim of “executive privilege.” One directive followed another,
gradually pulling down the secrecy curtain. The periodic,
quiet protests by Campbell went unnoticed by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
public until the usually mild-mannered Comptroller General
fired off a letter to Defense Secretary Neil McElroy.</p>

<p>“These restrictions,” Campbell wrote, “could seriously
hamper the General Accounting office in performing its
statutory responsibility and will impede the performance of
our work.”</p>

<p>He pointed out to McElroy that his GAO auditors could
not do their job in the face of directives that prohibited
them from examining the Inspector General reports, and
allowed them only a summary of reports as approved by the
Secretaries of the various armed services.</p>

<p>In a letter to Chairman Hebert, Campbell made his complaint
more specific:</p>

<p>“Any information or factual data directly bearing on a
program of activity subject to audit by the General Accounting
Office should not be withheld or subjected to procedures
designed to screen official documents, papers, or records,
by the authority or activity being audited.”</p>

<p>Later, in a letter to the Moss subcommittee on Government
Information, the Comptroller General stated that he
was seeking to make a study of the activity of the Inspector
General of the Air Force to determine how effective the
internal investigations had been.</p>

<p>He stated that to conduct such an investigation, the GAO
inspection must include:</p>

<p style="padding-left: 3em; text-indent: -1.5em;">1 A survey of the Air Force procurement methods (advertising
versus negotiation).</p>

<p style="padding-left: 3em; text-indent: -1.5em;">2 A survey of procurement quantitative and qualitative
program changes.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 3em; text-indent: -1.5em;">3 A survey of contract cost overruns.</p>

<p>“It is essential that such reports be made available to
the General Accounting Office in order that we can evaluate
the effectiveness of the department’s system of internal control
and to preclude unwarranted and unnecessary duplication<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
of effort in the internal audit and the independent
reviews made by this office,” Campbell wrote.</p>

<p>“There is no basis why reports on the subject of the types
pointed out above should not be made available to the General
Accounting Office unless the purpose is to delay or
hamper the efforts of the office to disclose all facts bearing
upon the activity or area under audit.</p>

<p>“We believe that any departmental regulation denying
to the General Accounting Office access to any report relating
to ‘internal audit and control’ is contrary to the law.”</p>

<p>It should be remembered that this was not a Democratic
congressman or senator accusing a Republican administration.
This was Joseph Campbell, long-time friend of President
Eisenhower, charging that the Eisenhower administration
was acting “contrary to the law” in the claim of an
“executive privilege.”</p>

<p>Congressman John Moss subsequently declared that
President Eisenhower was not discharging his duties under
the Constitution. Under Article II, Section 3 of the Constitution,
the President is obliged to “take care that the laws
be faithfully executed....” In this instance, President Eisenhower
was not only disregarding the Budgeting and Accounting
Act but also supporting those acting “contrary to the law,”
Moss said.</p>

<p>Although the fuss had started over GAO access to a sixty-two-page
Air Force inspector general report on the ballistic
missile program (see Appendix C), the real issue
was whether the Air Force, the Army, the Navy, or any other
executive agency could arbitrarily refuse to give reports,
papers, and financial records to the GAO.</p>

<p>It was difficult to follow President Eisenhower’s thinking.
This was a period of time when President Eisenhower and
members of his administration were emphasizing that
financial problems could be one of the nation’s big worries.
One of the major problems, they believed, was making sure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>
the government was getting its money’s worth from military
spending.</p>

<p>Even in times past, when GAO investigators were given
maximum access to records, serious scandals had been unearthed.
Most of them were not discovered by the military
establishment but came to light only after the GAO or the
congressional committees went to work. Chairman Hebert
and Campbell had a long record of fruitful hearings to back
them in questioning the wisdom (to say nothing of the
legality) of allowing our military spenders to erect more
barriers for the GAO auditors—the only independent outside
check on the billions spent on military matters.</p>

<p>At the presidential press conference on November 5, 1958,
I raised the question of the right of the General Accounting
Office to examine reports of the Air Force and the Defense
Department.</p>

<p>“Mr. President,” I said, “you have mentioned the spending
in the Defense Department here as one of the important
issues, and the General Accounting Office, which is the
watchdog on frauds and extravagances in the various
agencies, has been barred from reports over in the Air Force
and the Defense Department generally, and on this they [the
Air Force and Defense Department officials] claim that they
have authority from you to withhold reports if it is ‘expedient
to do so.’”</p>

<p>I tried to make the question conform as much as possible
to the precise trouble area between the GAO and the Defense
Department.</p>

<p>“I wonder,” I continued, “if you have given that authority
[to withhold] and if you feel that the GAO should have a full
rein to go in and investigate all indications of fraud and
extravagance?”</p>

<p>Replied the President: “You are obviously talking about
some special thing that I would have to study before I could
make—give an answer. I have stated this time and time<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>
again: I believe that every investigating committee of the
Congress, every auditing office, like the GAO, should always
have the opportunity to see official records if the security of
our country is not involved.”</p>

<p>President Eisenhower was now saying that the GAO
should have all records unless the security of our country
was involved. I tried to pin him down on it.</p>

<p>“Will they claim this, Mr. President, under ‘executive privilege—’”
I started my question.</p>

<p>President Eisenhower cut in before I had finished to avoid
any further comment. “No, that’s all I have to say—I told you
that is all I had to say for the moment.”</p>

<p>Representative Clare Hoffman, the wily Michigan Republican,
noted that President Eisenhower’s answer seemed to
bar use of “executive privilege” in refusing reports to the
GAO. A few days after the press conference, he wrote President
Eisenhower to call attention to the press conference exchange
and to ask:</p>

<p>“Did you mean to imply by your comments that the complete
text of Inspector General reports, including recommendations,
be made available to Congress and the General
Accounting Office?”</p>

<p>President Eisenhower’s letter to Representative Hoffman
on the same day again barred the GAO from the full reports
of inspectors general. The President said that “facts” in the
reports would be made available to the GAO, but that “recommendations
and other advisory matter” were not to be
released (see Appendix C).</p>

<p>The whole situation landed right back where it had
started. The Air Force, Navy, or Army officials would still
screen the Inspector General reports, eliminate material
they didn’t want to fall into the hands of GAO auditors, and
pass out their own self-serving summary to the investigators.
Law and logic had fallen by the wayside. The Budgeting
and Accounting Act might as well not have been written for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
all the good it was doing in forcing departments to produce
all pertinent documents.</p>

<p>The next big test came with the Navy. In February 1959,
Comptroller General Campbell wrote to the Moss subcommittee
stating that the secrecy curtain made it impossible
for him to fulfill his responsibility to audit Navy financial
affairs.</p>

<p>“We consider it illogical, impractical and contrary to express
provisions of the law for public officials to withhold,
in their discretion, information concerning the discharge of
their public trust,” Campbell wrote.</p>

<p>“We are advising the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary
of the Navy that we are unable to properly discharge
our statutory responsibility if information needed in our work
is denied to our representatives in the performance of our
audits.”</p>

<p>Representative William L. Dawson, chairman of the parent
House Government Operation Committee, instructed
Moss to prepare for public hearings. He wrote Campbell:</p>

<p>“I am sure everything possible will be done to overcome
the repeated arrogance of Federal executive officials whose
denial of information to the General Accounting Office flouts
the clear law of the land.”</p>

<p>Comptroller General Campbell said that the “executive
privilege” claim was being made by the Secretary of the
Navy on grounds that “he believes full disclosure of rank
opinions, advice and recommendations from persons at lower
levels ... would not be in the public interest.</p>

<p>“This same reasoning is now being applied by the
various bureaus and offices in the day-to-day work of their
employees.</p>

<p>“We believe that sound management practices require that
observations, opinions, and recommendations by subordinates
and any other matters considered in making a decision
should be a matter of record.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span></p>

<p>“All of these are matters upon which judgments are
founded and subsequent decision and actions are based.
Such documentation serves as a protection to the individual
making the decisions or taking the action as well as furnishing
a sound basis for subsequent appraisal of their timeliness,
effectiveness and honesty.”</p>

<p>Campbell complained that under Navy procedure at that
time “the individuals having custody of the materials are
required to screen the material and remove from the official
files any data they or their superiors feel we should not have.</p>

<p>“These actions provide a means by which the Department
could conceal substantive evidence of waste, extravagance,
improvident management, poor procurement practices, or
other adverse conditions.”</p>

<p>By March of 1959, Campbell had full proof that he could
not rely on the summary reports submitted to him by the
Navy. He declared that the Navy had submitted two reports
on one subject that were “incorrect representations” of the
government’s action. “The second version of the report, while
containing twice as many pages, is also incomplete and
inadequate because of the use of self-exercised censorship.”</p>

<p>Campbell said that the secrecy was not only illegal and
bad government but that it was mighty expensive. He explained
that the secrecy deprived the GAO auditors of information
already accumulated at the taxpayers’ expense.
This meant that the GAO was forced to go out and duplicate
work already done if it was to make any effort to fulfill its
responsibility.</p>

<p>Comptroller General Campbell put no price tag on the extra
cost for a GAO audit of the Navy. However, the GAO did
estimate that lack of access to the Air Force Inspector General
reports made that audit cost at least $125,000 more than
necessary. Though the cost of the audit could have been
avoided with the proper co-operation of the Air Force, the
audit ultimately disclosed millions of dollars in bungling and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>
waste in the Air Force missile program—all covered up in
the name of “executive privilege.”</p>

<p>The Richmond <cite>Times-Dispatch</cite> commented:</p>

<p>“The amazing thing about this situation is that President
Eisenhower backs the armed services in withholding vital
information from the GAO. He has been told by his legal
advisers that ‘executive privilege’ has some validity, where it
is in essence nothing but the determination of bureaucrats
to keep the GAO from seeing their books.</p>

<p>“This bogus doctrine forced the GAO to spend an extra
$125,000 in making its inquiry into Air Force mismanagement....
Just how much longer is the public going to put
up with this sort of thing?”</p>

<p>I knew that Virginius Dabney, editor of the Richmond
<cite>Times-Dispatch</cite>, was fed up with this expensive and undemocratic
secrecy. So was J. Russell Wiggins, executive editor
of the Washington <cite>Post and Times Herald</cite>; James Pope, executive
editor of the Louisville <cite>Courier-Journal</cite>; Herbert
Brucker, editor of the Hartford <cite>Courant</cite>; V. M. (Red) Newton,
managing editor of the Tampa <cite>Tribune</cite>; and Harold
Cross, the special counsel for the American Society of Newspaper
Editors.</p>

<p>The Chicago <cite>Daily News</cite>, the St. Louis <cite>Post-Dispatch</cite>,
and <cite>The Wall Street Journal</cite> were among the other top
papers firmly opposed to the secrecy cover-up. But despite
several excellent editorials, the problem just wasn’t flamboyant
enough to catch the attention of the public or even most
reporters. Too many news stories and editorials in other
papers merely repeated the self-serving justifications of the
Eisenhower administration without determining whether the
assertions were true.</p>

<span class="fs150">Hiding the Laos Mess</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">By the summer of 1959, Representative Porter Hardy was fed
up with arbitrary executive secrecy. The lanky Virginia
Democrat was getting a double dose of “executive privilege”
and had nearly reached the end of his patience. He was a
member of the Armed Services subcommittee headed by
Chairman Edward Hebert, and therefore had firsthand
knowledge of how the Defense Department was hampering
investigations of military waste.</p>

<p>Representative Hardy was also chairman of his own Foreign
Operations and Monetary Affairs Subcommittee. This
subcommittee (of the House Government Operations Committee)
was responsible for investigating the handling of
more than 60 billion dollars in foreign aid by the State Department
and the International Cooperation Administration
(ICA).</p>

<p>The Hardy subcommittee had a small staff of a half dozen
headed by John T. Reddan, the chief counsel. Under the
best circumstances, Hardy knew that they would be able to
look into only a few reports of mismanagement or fraud. But
a little scrutiny should soon tell whether the internal investigations
of ICA were being conducted in such a manner
that the Congress could rely on ICA to police itself.</p>

<p>To find out how well ICA was performing, it was necessary
to examine the files of complaints of fraud or mismanagement
and to determine how these complaints were being<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>
followed up by ICA investigators. But the ICA barred
Hardy’s committee staff members from examining the investigation
files as well as the evaluation reports ICA was
making on its own operations. Such files, Chairman Hardy
was told, would contain “advice, recommendations and conclusions,”
and, according to President Eisenhower’s May 17,
1954, letter, therefore, could not be released.</p>

<p>The investigation proceeded nonetheless. It was slow work,
but with patience and persistence Chief Counsel Reddan,
Counsel Richard Bray, Jr., Counsel Miles Q. Romney, and
Investigator Walton Woods pieced together the information
ICA had denied them. They got it by interviewing former
government employees, examining the files of business firms
with government contracts, and taking trips to other lands
to personally examine foreign-aid spending.</p>

<p>The little country of Laos in southeast Asia was one of
the first on which they concentrated. The picture was not
pretty. The administration of U.S. aid was creating at least
as many problems as it was trying to solve.</p>

<p>The aid program in Laos started in January 1955, when
that nation was granted its full independence. Laos had been
a part of French Indochina with Cambodia and Vietnam.
Independence for Laos had meant that the United States
took over the support of its entire military budget—41 million
dollars in 1955, 47 million dollars in 1956, 43 million dollars
in 1957, and 30 million dollars in 1958. Most of it went to
support a 25,000-man army. The subcommittee later concluded
that this military aid plus about 1.5 million dollars
annually in economic assistance added up to the fact that
the United States was “virtually supporting the entire
economy.”</p>

<p>As early as June 1957, the subcommittee received reports
indicating the foreign-aid program in Laos was being damaged
by waste, inefficiency, and poor judgment. After preliminary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>
inquiries, the formal investigation was started on
April 10, 1958.</p>

<p>The requests for ICA files on Laos foreign-aid spending
were rejected by ICA Director James W. Riddleberger. The
ICA also barred Chairman Hardy from files on India, Bolivia,
Brazil, and Guatemala.</p>

<p>A few months later, the ICA refused to let the GAO auditors
see the files on Laos.</p>

<p>Chairman Hardy was irked with the frustration, but downright
furious at what he considered to be a disregard of the
law. Certainly the ICA reports on Laos should be made
available to the GAO, for the Budgeting and Accounting Act
of 1921 provided explicitly that all records of all departments
must be made available to the GAO auditors.</p>

<p>Furthermore, when the foreign-aid program had been established
in 1948, the debates had included discussion of the
accounting on foreign aid and the necessity for availability of
information to Congress.</p>

<p>At that time Senator Arthur Vandenberg, the Michigan
Republican, commented:</p>

<p>“There are several points in the bill where it is provided
that Congress is to be advised. In addition, we are creating
... the ‘watchdog’ committee [Joint Committee on Economic
Cooperation] ... which will be entitled to all information
of every character at all times.”</p>

<p>Despite the law and the intention of the lawmakers, the
ICA had clamped the secrecy lid on, and kept it on. ICA also
rejected GAO requests for information on foreign-aid spending
in Formosa, India, Vietnam, Pakistan, France, Turkey,
and others.</p>

<p>In its investigation of but one of the foreign-aid programs—the
one in Laos—the Hardy subcommittee unearthed enough
evidence of incompetence, laxity, mismanagement, and fraud
to fill scores of pages of an official report.</p>

<p>The military program for a 25,000-man Laotian army, for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>
example, arose from a political decision made by the State
Department and contrary to the recommendations of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Defense Department. “Significant
military opinion has suggested a force of 12,000 to
15,000,” the Hardy subcommittee reported.</p>

<p>The subcommittee also found favoritism, conflict of interest,
and bribery in connection with ICA contracts in Laos.
“Edward T. McNamara, [ICA] public works and industry
officer, accepted bribes totaling at least $13,000 from Willis
H. Bird and Gerald A. Peabody of the Universal Construction
Co., in return for helping them secure lucrative contracts
and overlooking deficiencies in their performance.”</p>

<p>The subcommittee reported dozens of incidents of minor
officials’ showing favoritism toward firms that later employed
them. One sharp charge was aimed at the man who headed
the United States Operations Mission (USOM) during part
of this period.</p>

<p>“Carter dePaul, former USOM director, sold his 1947
Cadillac upon his departure from Laos to Gerald A. Peabody,
head of Universal, at an inflated price [about $3000]. Uncontroverted
evidence indicates the vehicle was at that time
inoperable, and that shortly thereafter it was cut up and the
pieces dropped down an abandoned well. In the interim, it
had stood rusting in front of Universal’s main office, where it
was the subject of scornful amusement by Laotians and
Americans alike.”</p>

<p>More shocking than the frauds was the evidence dug up
by the subcommittee showing that U. S. Embassy officials
in Laos and high ICA officials in Washington took no effective
remedial action after receiving reports of corruption and
mismanagement. Greater energy was obviously being expended
in hiding the mess from Chairman Hardy and his
investigators.</p>

<p>The subcommittee’s evidence indicated that an investigator
for the ICA Auditor Haynes Miller, “was ‘railroaded’ out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
of Laos because he was close to discovering the truth about
Universal, its bribes, its virtual monopoly of U.S. aid
construction projects ... and its woefully inadequate
performance.”</p>

<p>This action to remove Auditor Miller seemed more reprehensible
to me than any ordinary theft or misuse of money
or government power. This was evidence that there was a
brutal conspiracy within the U. S. Embassy in Laos to
eliminate those officials who were complaining of fraud and
mismanagement and to shield persons who were engaged in
wrongdoing. It demonstrated what could happen when
government officials feel they have an “executive privilege”
to hide the records on their activities.</p>

<p>Miller’s reports and his persistent efforts to get something
done about deficiencies in the program only resulted in his
removal. He was “unable to adjust” to Laos, some of his
superiors and associates said. U. S. Ambassador J. Graham
Parsons sent a telegram to Washington stating he had invited
the investigator to resign “because of obvious signs of
nervous disorder.”</p>

<p>“Ambassador Parsons’ opinion of Miller’s ‘nervous disorder’
was rendered without benefit of medical advice,” the Hardy
subcommittee reported. “This is contrary to Department of
State regulations. Competent medical advice was available
to the Ambassador and could have been solicited.”</p>

<p>“One month later, on October 30, 1957,” the report added,
“Miller was subjected to a full medical examination in Washington
and certified as ‘qualified for general duty.’”</p>

<p>Officials of the ICA excused the deficiencies and maladministration
in the Laos program with the claim that the aid
program, no matter how poorly administered, had saved
Laos from Communism.</p>

<p>“This assertion is purely speculative, and can be neither
proved nor disproved,” the Hardy subcommittee stated in
1959. That was two years before it was generally realized<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>
that a corrupt aid program had probably helped the Communists
in Laos.</p>

<p>Even in 1959 the Hardy subcommittee concluded “that a
lesser sum of money more efficiently administered would
have been far more effective in achieving economic and
political stability in Laos, and in increasing its capacity
to reject Communist military aggression or political
subversion.”</p>

<p>At a press conference on July 2, 1959, two weeks after the
Laos report was issued, William McGaffin, of the Chicago
<cite>Daily News</cite>, put the problem of secrecy in ICA to President
Eisenhower.</p>

<p>“Mr. President,” McGaffin started, “do you see any solution
to the quarrel between Congress and the executive
branch of the Government over the question of freedom of
information?”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know exactly what you are adverting to
when you say freedom of information,” President Eisenhower
said and then jumped for the safety of George Washington’s
shadow:</p>

<p>“This question, from the time of Washington, has been a
live one. When the Executive determines that something is to
the—will damage the security of the United States or its
vital interest, then it withholds information that possibly
could be put out. But I don’t know of any specific thing
which you are talking about at this moment.”</p>

<p>McGaffin bounced back:</p>

<p>“Mr. President, if I could just spell it out briefly: Congress
seems perturbed over various instances where they feel that
the executive branch has misused the claim of ‘executive
privileges’ and denied them information which they should
have.</p>

<p>“For instance,” McGaffin continued: “There are evaluation
reports made by the ICA on certain countries which
have received mutual security—Formosa, Laos, Brazil, Guatemala—a
whole string of them, and Congress has raised the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>
point where they are going to try to pass a law which would
compel ICA to turn that information over to them.”</p>

<p>President Eisenhower confused the problem with national
security in answering:</p>

<p>“Well, there are certain things, particularly in the security
field, that, if you reveal, are very obviously damaging to the
United States and I think anyone of good sense will see that.
And you simply must take measures to see that those things
are not revealed.</p>

<p>“And, now, this has been—there is nothing new about this.
The Executive, and there seems to be a sort of congenital
built-in mutual opposition that I don’t know why it occurs,
I don’t particularly feel it personally, but I know it’s there
and at times it comes to my attention in one form or another.</p>

<p>“But,” said the President, retreating to the safety of his
reputation as an honest man, “I am using my own conscience
on the matter and when such things as these come to
me for decision, I shall continue to do so.”</p>

<p>It was a most unsatisfactory answer on a most important
question involving the policing of spending by the Defense
Department and the ICA. I decided to follow up where the
Hardy subcommittee and Bill McGaffin left off. At the next
press conference, on July 15, 1959, I caught President Eisenhower’s
eye.</p>

<p>“Mr. President,” I started. “Several committees of Congress
have charged that departments of your administration
have used the secrecy of the so-called ‘executive privilege’
to hide imprudence, mismanagement, fraud, and in some
cases material which has later resulted in indictments. I
wonder if you have taken any steps to correct this?”</p>

<p>President Eisenhower’s eyes blazed with anger. Despite
his emotion he remained controlled enough to avoid the kind
of comments on facts or law that had put him in so much
trouble in the past. He said:</p>

<p>“I think you had better put that question in written form
and let me take a look at it because you start off, right off<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>
the bat, with the premise or implication that someone is
guilty of fraud and I don’t believe it.”</p>

<p>When I attempted to reply that the charges of fraud and
mismanagement were included in official reports of Congress,
he cut me off sharply. “I will see your letter if you would
like to submit it.”</p>

<p>In the letter to President Eisenhower, I tried to be careful
and to be respectful of his position:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>My dear Mr. President: In response to your request, I
am submitting the basic question which I asked at the
July 15, 1959, press conference. I regret that the statement
of the question at the press conference raised any implication
of fraud, or knowledge of fraud, at the White House
level. Such an implication was not intended. The question
was based on the findings of various committees of the
Congress. In general the reports dealt with subordinate
officials who, it is contended, used the so-called executive
privilege in an effort to conceal their activities from
investigators of Congress and the General Accounting
Office.</p>

<p>Several committees of Congress have made reports
charging that officials in some departments of Government
have used the secrecy of executive privilege to hide
what the committees called carelessness, mismanagement,
fraud, and other alleged improprieties. Comptroller General
Joseph Campbell has told the Congress that some
executive departments have violated the law—the Budgeting
and Accounting Act—in withholding reports from him
in connection with waste, mismanagement and improprieties.
Mr. Campbell has testified before the House Appropriations
Committee that this secrecy is a violation of
the law, and he also stated that it “could be almost fatal”
to vital auditing functions his office performs.</p>

<p>Comptroller General Campbell and the Moss subcommittee,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>
among others, have raised the question as to
whether this withholding of information is inconsistent
with the Constitutional requirements that the Chief Executive
“take care that the laws be faithfully executed.”</p>

<p>There is no problem of national security involved. The
Air Force and Navy have informed Congress and the GAO
that no national security is involved, since the GAO auditors
have the same clearance to examine classified material
as do the officials in the departments.</p>

<p>Against this background, I would rephrase my question
as follows: In the light of the provisions of the Budgeting
and Accounting Act, do you feel you have an
executive responsibility to carry out the law in line with
the Comptroller General’s views?</p>
</div>

<p>The answer, from Gerald D. Morgan, Deputy Assistant to
the President, reached me a few days later on July 21.
Morgan merely quoted from the President’s letter to Representative
Hoffman of some months before, and from other
earlier statements of his on “executive privilege.”</p>

<p>Morgan wrote, “The President’s position has not changed.”
I was not convinced that President Eisenhower knew
what his position was. The letter left all basic questions
unanswered.</p>

<p>The foreign-aid bill, amending the Mutual Security Act
of 1954, was now before the Congress, and Representative
Hardy had tacked on an amendment specifically stating that
“all documents, papers, communications, audits, reviews,
findings, recommendation reports and other material which
relate to the operation or activities of the International Cooperation
Administration shall be furnished to the General
Accounting Office” and authorized committees of Congress.</p>

<p>On July 24, 1959, President Eisenhower signed the bill
with Hardy’s amendment, including three provisions for disclosure
of information to the Congress or the GAO. In signing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>
it, however, the President served notice he would not
abide by the disclosure sections:</p>

<p>“I have signed this bill on the express premise that the
three amendments relating to disclosure are not intended to
alter and cannot alter the recognized constitutional duty
and power of the executive with respect to the disclosure
of information, documents, and other materials. Indeed, any
other construction of these amendments would raise grave
constitutional question under the historic separation of
powers doctrine.”</p>

<p>Five days later at the July 29, 1959, press conference I
asked the President if he considered the provisions in the bill
to cut off funds to balky agencies to be “a criticism of the
administration’s secrecy policies.”</p>

<p>President Eisenhower turned red in the face at the reference
to “secrecy” in his administration. “You start your
question with an implied fact that is not a fact,” he said.
“You say the administration’s secrecy policies. There has
been no administration....”</p>

<p>I tried to amplify my question, but was cut off.</p>

<p>“Please sit down,” the President said sharply. I sat on
orders from the Commander in Chief, and he continued:</p>

<p>“There has been no administration since my memory, and
I have been in this city since 1926, who has gone to such
lengths to make information available as long as the national
security and the national interest of this country is not
involved.”</p>

<p>It was fruitless for me to try to stand up and tell him what
was happening in his administration. So I sat still and took
it. The support that came later from editors over the country
was most gratifying.</p>

<p>V. M. (Red) Newton, Jr., managing editor of the Tampa
<cite>Tribune</cite>, wrote to President Eisenhower:</p>

<p>“Mr. Mollenhoff’s question at the press conference about
your administration’s ‘secrecy policies’ had to do with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>
House of Representatives provisions in the foreign aid bill
that would force the bureaucracy to give information of this
foreign aid to the Congress.</p>

<p>“Both the Congress, which votes the expenditure, and the
American people, who pay the tax funds, are entitled to full
information.”</p>

<p>The Richmond <cite>Times-Dispatch</cite> in an editorial entitled
“Does Eisenhower Understand?” commented: “Somebody is
going to have to explain to President Eisenhower that the
‘executive privilege’ dogma, which originated in his first term
five years ago, is being perverted into a device for ‘covering
up’ and denying the public the facts concerning the
government.”</p>

<p>The editorial commented on the “corruption, profiteering
and mismanagement in Laos” in the ICA, and the fact that
the Teapot Dome scandals would never have been uncovered
if such a principle as “executive privilege” had been invoked.</p>

<p>“So it would be advisable for Mr. Eisenhower to look into
this ‘executive privilege’ thing much more carefully than he
has done so far. He will find that it carries within itself the
seeds of scandal, and offers needless temptation to department
heads. It should be abolished.”</p>

<p><cite>The Wall Street Journal</cite> editorialized on the “Misplaced
Anger” of President Eisenhower. It gave President Eisenhower
full credit as a “man who believes that public office is
a public trust.” But the <cite>Journal</cite> in its usual fair but solid way
called attention to the entire problem of the GAO’s obtaining
access to government records so it could fulfill its
responsibility.</p>

<p>“If he [the President] were to inquire into the extent of
secrecy,” said <cite>The Wall Street Journal</cite>, “we have an idea the
President would be far more angered at some of his own
bureaucrats than at the reporter who brought the secrecy to
his attention.”</p>

<p>The Hartford <cite>Courant</cite>, edited by Herbert Brucker, carried<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>
an equally fine editorial. Brucker was chairman of the Freedom
of Information Committee of the American Society of
Newspaper Editors, and was one of a handful of the editors
who knew the subject thoroughly.</p>

<p>By this time editors of a couple dozen newspapers had
done considerable study on the problem of “executive privilege.”
Although cognizant of the many problems weighing
on President Eisenhower, they felt the time had come for him
to make himself aware of the insidious secrecy that was creeping
into the federal government under his prestige.</p>

<p>It was a week after this press conference that James W.
Riddleberger, Director of the ICA, refused to make evaluation
reports available to Congress on the foreign-aid program
in Laos and Vietnam.</p>

<p>Now Chairman Hardy saw that a disclosure amendment
to the Mutual Security law would not be enough to force the
Eisenhower administration to produce records for the GAO
and the Congress. The 3.1-billion-dollar foreign-aid appropriations
bill was still pending in Congress, and Hardy decided
<ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;original text: to to">to</ins> try to use an amendment to this purse-string
measure to force the Eisenhower administration to produce
records.</p>

<p>The House was unanimous in adopting the Hardy amendment
to the appropriations bill. This amendment provided
that the Comptroller General could shut off aid funds to any
program if records were refused to Congress and GAO
investigators.</p>

<p>The Eisenhower administration was gravely concerned
over this amendment. Riddleberger voiced the opposition,
and the Senate weakened in the face of administration pressure.
The Senate version of the appropriations bill carried
the provision that the President could authorize withholding
by a simple certification “that he has forbidden its being
furnished ... and his reason for so doing.” In a late night
session the Senate-House conference committee accepted the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>
huge loophole in the Senate version of the appropriations
bill.</p>

<p>Representative Hardy recognized it immediately as a loophole
that could destroy the effectiveness of his amendment.
A simple note from the President would override any request
by Congress or the GAO.</p>

<p>Would President Eisenhower read the documents necessary
to determine for himself whether a certification for
withholding was justified? It seemed more likely to his
critics that he would sign certifications continuing to bar the
GAO and Congress from a thorough examination of the
internal workings of the foreign-aid program. Chairman
Hardy’s fears were justified. It wasn’t long before his requests
for information were being met with “certification” from
President Eisenhower giving only the most general reasons.</p>

<p>The Congress could have done more than it did. It unquestionably
had the necessary power, reaffirmed by the
Supreme Court as recently as 1957 in the Watkins case. The
Court said:</p>

<p>“The power of Congress to conduct investigations is inherent
in the legislative process. That power is broad. It
encompasses inquiries concerning the administration of existing
laws as well as proposed or possibly needed statutes.
It includes surveys of defects in our social, economic, or
political system for the purpose of enabling the Congress
to remedy them. It comprehends probes into departments of
the Federal Government to expose corruption, inefficiency
and waste.”</p>

<p>I was unsuccessful in my efforts to get Speaker Sam Rayburn
or Majority Leader Lyndon B. Johnson interested in
taking any effective measures to reaffirm the right of Congress
to compel production of records for GAO.</p>

<p>Congress did deliver the Eisenhower administration one
blow in 1959 in connection with the “executive privilege”
issue. That was when President Eisenhower nominated Admiral<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>
Lewis Strauss to be Secretary of Commerce. The hearings
before the Interstate and Foreign Commerce Committee
started on March 17, and pulled out past the middle of May.
Although a good many personality clashes were involved,
the role that Strauss had played in the Dixon-Yates contract
and his advocacy of extreme “executive privilege” also
figured.</p>

<p>The report favoring the Strauss confirmation stated: “Our
committee spent much time in detail examination of specific
instances in which it is charged that the nominee withheld
or was grudging in giving information to congressional committees.
The few instances charged represent a minute percentage
of the nominee’s dealings with the Congress.</p>

<p>“In fact, the nominee showed great diligence in keeping
the Congress informed,” concluded the six Republicans and
two Democrats who signed the majority report.</p>

<p>When questioned about the Dixon-Yates contract, Strauss
had said: “I thought it was a good contract and I still do ...
it would have cost the people a great deal less than the plant
... is now going to cost.”</p>

<p>Strauss denied that he had used “executive privilege” to
hold out information from Congress in the Dixon-Yates
controversy.</p>

<p>“No information was withheld by me,” he said. “No question
failed of answer except one which was several times
repeated and to which I respectfully declined response on
ground that to demand conversations had with the President
or members of his personal staff would be in violation of the
constitutional doctrine of separation of powers ... I testified
that the contract with Mississippi Valley Generating
Company had been entered into at the direction of the President
and had been terminated at the direction of the President,
and that, I submit, should have been sufficient.”</p>

<p>Strauss claimed a total right under “executive privilege” to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>
refuse records to Congress, and the seven-member Democratic
minority concluded:</p>

<p>“The record ... indicates such withholding is without
basis in law, and that the nominee had no concern for the
law in this respect. From the record it is clear that the
nominee time after time has resisted furnishing the appropriate
committees of the Congress with information needed in
order for Congress to properly perform its legislative
functions.</p>

<p>“It appears to us from careful attention to the testimony,
that Mr. Strauss had withheld or manipulated information to
serve policy or personal ends. On the basis of the record, we
have grave doubts as to whether or not information furnished
by Mr. Strauss, as Secretary of Commerce, would be accurate
or complete.”</p>

<p>The minority position was to prevail on the Senate floor
where the Strauss nomination was defeated.</p>

<p>Senator Mike Monroney, the Oklahoma Democrat, explained
his opposition to the Strauss nomination thus:</p>

<p>“Both the people and the press are entitled to expect from
the legislative branch of Government the vigilant protection
of the people’s right to know. For the Senate to seek to give
protection in the exercise of its power of confirmation is
not only proper, it is obligatory.</p>

<p>“I conceive it to be basic to democratic government that
the people and their elected representatives in the Congress,
are entitled to receive from the officials of the executive
branch, not merely literal truth, but full information, freely
given without design to soothe, to confuse or divert.”</p>

<p>When the Strauss nomination was defeated in mid-June,
I had hopes that the Congress was on the way to recognizing
the problem of “executive privilege” for all that it was. But
by the end of the year it was apparent that most of the members
of Congress had gone back to their little personal problems<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>
and had left Moss, Hennings, Hardy, and a few others
to wrestle with the big problem of how to obtain an adequate
GAO audit of spending that involved more than half the total
national budget.</p>

<span class="fs150">Defiance to the End, Above the Law</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">From the investigation of the aid program in Laos, Representative
Porter Hardy and his subcommittee staff moved on
to the aid programs in Latin America. The subcommittee
had examined some Latin-American aid programs as early as
1955 and unearthed several deficiencies. But the Eisenhower
administration had claimed that the shortcomings were due
largely to the newness of the programs and suggested that
the subcommittee examine them again five years later.</p>

<p>The five years had now elapsed, and on April 28, 1960,
Chairman Hardy notified Secretary of State Christian Herter
and ICA Director Riddleberger that he was initiating an investigation
of the aid programs to Brazil, Uruguay, Argentina,
Chile, Bolivia, Peru, and Colombia.</p>

<p>Several new laws were on the books to facilitate the investigation.
The 1959 law establishing the office of Inspector
General and Comptroller (OIGC) in the State Department
provided that:</p>

<p>“All documents, papers, communications, audits, reviews,
findings, recommendations, reports, and other material
which relate to the operation or activities of the Office of
Inspector General and Comptroller shall be furnished the
General Accounting Office and to any committee of the
Congress, or any duly authorized subcommittee thereof.”</p>

<p>The Congress in 1960 amended the Mutual Security Act
providing the GAO could shut off funds to the OIGC if that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>
agency did not furnish records requested in a reasonable
time.</p>

<p>Chairman Hardy’s staff had also called his attention to another
law (5 U.S.C. 105 [a]) which provided that every department
shall, upon request of the Government Operations
Committee, “furnish any information requested of it relating
to any matters within the jurisdiction of said committee.”</p>

<p>Added to these laws, and the previously mentioned Budgeting
and Accounting Act of 1921, was the fact that the State
Department was preparing to ask Congress for more money
for aid to Latin America. The stage was legally and psychologically
well set for co-operation. And Chairman Hardy was
indeed advised that he would receive full co-operation. It
never came. When his first requests for files on the Bolivia
program produced no results in six weeks, Hardy notified
the State Department and ICA that hearings would begin on
the information policy on June 28, 1960.</p>

<p>The hearings revealed that the State Department had constructed
an involved thirteen-step routine for clearing papers
for Congress, and the papers Hardy requested simply had
not been cleared. Eric H. Hager, legal adviser of the Department
of State, identified himself as the man responsible for
the new system.</p>

<p>It was found that in one instance it took six weeks for one
subcommittee request to clear eight of the thirteen steps.
When Chairman Hardy tried to find out what had happened
to the request for documents, he learned that the request and
the documents were resting in the “in box” in the Office of
the Assistant Secretary of State for Congressional Relations.
The papers had been gathering dust in the box for two weeks
and were only moved when the State Department started to
prepare for the hearing.</p>

<p>In the report on the hearings, Hardy’s subcommittee explained
the need for original documents as “the best evidence
available” on the internal operations of ICA.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span></p>

<p>“It has been the policy and practice of the subcommittee,
in order to insure accurate reporting of these complex operations,
to support its findings with documentary corroboration
from files of the executive agencies,” the report stated.</p>

<p>“The subcommittee has sought to obtain the facts from the
documents and records ... as they are prepared in the
ordinary course of doing business, rather than to rely upon
oral testimony or upon secondary documents prepared especially
for the subcommittee’s consideration.”</p>

<p>The report scored “executive privilege” as a “nebulous
doctrine” that had plagued the subcommittee with delays.
Again it was pointed out that the withholding of information
was in violation of clear laws imposing a duty to make
records available to Congress. The report stated that the
subcommittee had sought to be reasonable in its request, and
“on several occasions [has] withdrawn its requests for particular
documents at the suggestion of the executive branch.
Examples of documents in this category are certain memoranda
recording high-level discussions between Department
of State officials and senior officials of foreign governments.”</p>

<p>The report stated it should be understood that this willingness
to refrain from pressing for certain documents was
not a recognition of any right to withhold them. It continued:</p>

<p>“No court decision has settled the question of whether
executive officials may refuse to honor a request of a congressional
committee for papers, documents and records.
Many court decisions, however, have upheld the power of
congressional committees to obtain records and papers in the
possession of private individuals, corporations, and associations
even though such records might be regarded as of a
highly personal nature. It logically follows that the power of
Congress to obtain information regarding the public business,
the exercise of authority granted by Congress, or the
expenditure of funds appropriated by Congress would likewise
be upheld in the event of a court test.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span></p>

<p>“If Congress is to discharge its constitutional legislative
and policymaking functions, it must have reliable information
about the public business.”</p>

<p>To allow the executive branch to pick and choose what the
Congress would be allowed to examine “can, and frequently
does, result in giving Congress a distorted picture,” the report
said.</p>

<p>Then it suggested the use of two existing powers of Congress
to oppose this abuse of power by the executive: the
power of subpoena, and the power of the purse.</p>

<p>“The power of subpoena, however, should be used only as
a last resort. Utilizing the power of the purse, the Congress
can and should provide, in authorizing and appropriating
legislation, that the continued availability of appropriated
funds is contingent upon the furnishing of complete and
accurate information relating to the expenditure of such
funds to the General Accounting Office and to the appropriate
committees of Congress at their request.”</p>

<p>A week after the report was issued, Chairman Hardy sent
a letter to the ICA, State Department, and the Development
Loan Fund asking for all documents on programs for seven
Latin-American countries. His staff had already obtained
considerable information from sources outside ICA indicating
mismanagement, conflicts of interest, and other corruption
in the program in Peru.</p>

<p>A month later, on October 11, 1960, President Eisenhower
issued a formal order denying access to the records Hardy
had requested.</p>

<p>Three weeks later, on October 31, 1960, Chairman Hardy
made a formal request for specific ICA documents from the
Office of Inspector General and Comptroller. This set the
groundwork for shutting off funds to the Office of Inspector
General and Comptroller under the provisions of the 1960
Amendment to the Mutual Security Act cited earlier in this
chapter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span></p>

<p>President Eisenhower followed up a month later, on December
2, with a certification denying access to these OIGC
documents and eighty other documents requested.</p>

<p>Here was the showdown to determine how far President
Eisenhower would go in overriding the express provisions of
the 1959 law establishing the Office of Inspector General
and Comptroller. Chairman Hardy notified the GAO of the
OIGC refusal to produce records. And Comptroller General
Joseph Campbell, as head of GAO, filed notice that unless the
documents were made available the funds for OIGC would
be shut off on December 9.</p>

<p>By so doing, Campbell ruled that the refusal to produce
the documents on foreign aid to Latin-American countries
was a violation of the law even if the orders were issued by
his one-time close associate, President Eisenhower.</p>

<p>On December 9, Gerald Morgan, Deputy Assistant to the
President, requested a ruling from Attorney General William
P. Rogers, and thirteen days later Rogers wrote President
Eisenhower (see Appendix C). The Attorney General, as
would be expected from his earlier espousal of the most extreme
interpretation of “executive privilege,” declared Comptroller
General Campbell’s ruling “erroneous.” In his opinion,
the President had a constitutional right to withhold whatever
he wanted to withhold. Rogers advised President Eisenhower
that he had the authority to direct the Secretary of the Treasury
and the Secretary of State to disregard the ruling of the
Comptroller General cutting off funds for the Office of Inspector
General and Comptroller.</p>

<p>With this advice in hand, President Eisenhower, on December
23, overrode the disclosure provisions of the Mutual
Security Act of 1959 and the ruling of the Comptroller
General he had appointed. In letters to Secretary of Treasury
Robert B. Anderson and to Secretary of State Christian
Herter, President Eisenhower told them to use federal funds
to pay the Office of Inspector General and Comptroller.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span></p>

<p>He called attention to Campbell’s contention that such
payments were to be cut off under the law passed in 1959,
and added:</p>

<p>“This position, I am advised by the Attorney General, is
based upon erroneous interpretation of law which would
reach an unconstitutional result and that mutual security
program funds continue to be made available for expenses
of the Office of Inspector General and Comptroller.”</p>

<p>“Accordingly, you are hereby directed, until the end of my
term of office on January 20, 1961, to cause disbursements to
be made for such expenses upon the receipt of certified
vouchers presented for that purpose.”</p>

<p>Chairman Hardy continued the investigation of Peru. But
he had need for documents that would be crucial in establishing
the degree of mismanagement and corruption in the
ICA program there. The most he could do now was to hope
for better success under the new administration. However, he
did not want to present President-elect John F. Kennedy with
a problem for solution on or before the January 20 inaugural
ceremonies.</p>

<p>He talked to Theodore Sorenson, Administrative Assistant
to Senator Kennedy and later counsel to the President, and
informed him of the pending problem. Hardy stated that he
would withdraw his request which could prevent payment of
OIGC personnel if he received assurances from the President-elect
that the new administration would review the problem
immediately after the inaugural.</p>

<p>On December 31, 1960, Hardy received a telegram from
President-elect Kennedy asking that he postpone action on
the documents until the new administration had “an opportunity
to review [the] situation.” Hardy complied.</p>

<p>The night of January 18, 1961, President Eisenhower went
before a nationwide audience to give his “farewell address.”
He appealed for an “alert and knowledgeable citizenry” to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>
combat the military-industrial complex that could “endanger
our liberties or democratic processes.”</p>

<p>“This conjunction of an immense military establishment
and a large arms industry is new in the American experience,”
President Eisenhower said. “The total influence—economic,
political, even spiritual—is felt in every city, every
statehouse, every office of the Government.</p>

<p>“We recognize the imperative need for this development.
Yet we must not fail to comprehend its grave implications.
Our toil, resources, and livelihood are all involved: so is the
very structure of our society.</p>

<p>“In the council of Government, we must guard against the
acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought,
by the military-industrial complex. The potential for
the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist.”</p>

<p>[Congressman Edward Hebert, of Louisiana, had made a
good many comments on the military-industrial complex,
and he had conducted a fine investigation documenting some
of the problems. But the record indicated Chairman Hebert
had not received full co-operation from the Eisenhower administration.
Now President Eisenhower was expressing as
much concern as Hebert.]</p>

<p>“We must never let the weight of this combination endanger
our liberties or democratic processes,” President
Eisenhower warned. “We should take nothing for granted.
Only an alert and knowledgeable citizenry can compel the
proper meshing of the huge industrial and military machinery
of defense with our peaceful methods and goals, so that
security and liberty may prosper together.</p>

<p>“Partly because of the huge costs involved, a Government
contract becomes virtually a substitute for intellectual curiosity.
For every old blackboard there are now hundreds of
new electronic computers.</p>

<p>“The prospect of domination of the Nation’s scholars by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>
Federal employment, project allocations, and the power of
money is very present—and is gravely to be regarded.”</p>

<p>President Eisenhower might have added that the arbitrary
withholding of information from Congress and the public
was the quickest way to give this military-industrial combination
the control he believed to be so dangerous. He
apparently had never understood the secrecy problem in his
administration in such a way that he could see the connection
between the increase in secrecy and the decrease in
liberty and other essential elements of democracy. Chairman
Hardy, I myself, and others hoped the new President would.</p>

<span class="fs150">Kennedy Makes a Wobbly Start</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">President John F. Kennedy had been in office only ten days
when he gave his “State of the Union” address on January
30, 1961. His comments on making information available to
Congress were general in nature and seemingly consistent
with his campaign pledges. President Kennedy said:</p>

<p>“Our Constitution wisely assigns both joint and separate
roles to each branch of the Government; and a President and
a Congress who hold each other in mutual respect will
neither permit nor attempt any trespass. For my part, I shall
withhold from neither the Congress nor the people any fact
or report, past, present, or future, which is necessary for an
informed judgment of our conduct or hazards. I shall neither
shift the burden of executive decisions to the Congress, nor
avoid responsibility for the outcome of those decisions.”</p>

<p>President Kennedy was not so specific on the subject as
Candidate Kennedy had been, nor was he as precise as the
Democratic platform on “Freedom of Information.” The
Democratic platform said:</p>

<p>“We reject the Republican contention that the workings of
government are the special private preserve of the Executive.
The massive wall of secrecy erected between the Executive
branch and the Congress as well as the citizen must be torn
down. Information must flow freely, save in those areas in
which the national security is involved.”</p>

<p>During the 1960 campaign, President Kennedy made a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>
most forthright declaration on the responsibility of the President
to keep the citizens fully informed so that democracy
would flourish.</p>

<p>“An informed citizenry is the basis of representative
government,” he said. “Democracy—as we know it—cannot
exist unless the American people are equipped with the information
which is necessary if they are to make the informed
political choices on which the proper functioning of
the democracy depends. An informed people—able to examine,
and when necessary, to criticize, its government—is
the only guarantee of responsible democracy.”</p>

<p>As a candidate, Kennedy also declared that the President
had much more than a negative duty.</p>

<p>“The President—who himself bears much of the responsibility
for the preservation of American democracy—has the
affirmative duty to see that the American people are kept
fully informed. It is true that in today’s world of peril some
Government information must be kept secret—information
whose publication would endanger the security of national
security—the people of the United States are entitled to the
fullest possible information about their Government—and the
President must see that they receive it.”</p>

<p>Senator Kennedy said that the “executive privilege” should
be reserved for the exclusive use of the President. He added
that when information is not restricted by specific statute,
security needs, or the Constitution, “there is no justification
for using the doctrine of ‘executive privilege’ to withhold that
information from Congress and the public.”</p>

<p>On February 4—only two weeks after Kennedy’s inauguration—Secretary
of State Dean Rusk wrote Representative
Porter Hardy.</p>

<p>“Just a note to let you know that we have not forgotten
the question on the availability of records. I am working with
our new legal adviser, Mr. Abram Chayes, and hope that he
can be in touch with you during the coming week. Let me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>
assure you that we will move on this matter as promptly as
possible.”</p>

<p>Chairman Hardy was now optimistic about gaining access
to the reports and papers of the International Cooperation
Administration programs in Peru and six other Latin-American
nations. Three days later, Chayes called at Hardy’s
office, and the following day Chairman Hardy wrote a
friendly little note to Secretary of State Rusk saying that he
trusted the access problem “will be resolved quickly.”</p>

<p>More than two weeks passed without action, however,
and with each day Chairman Hardy became more irritated.
On February 28, he wrote Rusk prodding him again on the
need for the documents on foreign-aid programs in Brazil,
Uruguay, Argentina, Chile, Bolivia, Peru, and Colombia. The
subcommittee has “directed the staff to examine all executive
branch documents and files relating to the U.S. aid operations
in the aforesaid countries and to interview such department
and agency personnel as may be necessary.”</p>

<p>There was still no action from Secretary of State Rusk,
and ten days later Hardy had reached the end of his patience.
He wrote a letter to President Kennedy and delivered
it to the White House to President Kennedy’s appointment
secretary, Kenneth O’Donnell.</p>

<p>It was a Friday afternoon, and O’Donnell informed Chairman
Hardy he would put the letter in the President’s hands
the first thing Monday morning. Hardy said he felt this was
important enough that it should be delivered to President
Kennedy that day, for he planned to conduct hearings on
the affair on Monday. O’Donnell said he would get the letter
to the President immediately.</p>

<p>Hardy’s letter informed President Kennedy of the background
of delays, and the promise of the new administration
made to find a speedy solution.</p>

<p>“Seven weeks have now elapsed since the inauguration
and I have no reason to believe that a workable solution is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>
any nearer than it was on December 9, 1960, under the
former administration,” Hardy wrote. “You may recall that
it was on that date that the Comptroller General prohibited
further use of program funds for expenses of the office of the
Inspector General and Comptroller because of its failure to
furnish my subcommittee with requested documents in accordance
with ... the Mutual Security Act of 1954, as
amended.”</p>

<p>Hardy was polite but direct:</p>

<p>“I regret the necessity of bringing this matter to your attention,
and would be reluctant to intrude on your busy
schedule if I were not aware of the importance of this matter
to you. In this connection, I feel you should know that it is
my present plan to hold a meeting of my subcommittee on
Monday of next week to discuss the advisability of scheduling
promptly a hearing to which Secretary Rusk would be invited
to inform the subcommittee concerning the extent of
co-operation which we can expect in securing the information
necessary for us to discharge our constitutional and
statutory responsibilities.</p>

<p>“As I am sure you are aware, I have made every effort
to avoid the necessity of seeking a solution to the problem in
this manner. However, I feel that the lack of success of other
methods to date leaves me no alternative.”</p>

<p>Before Hardy had reached his home, President Kennedy
had called and left a number. This wasn’t somebody calling
for the President, but the President himself. Hardy returned
the call, and was assured by President Kennedy that Secretary
of State Rusk would be in touch with him. Rusk called
a few minutes later, and promised immediate action on the
information problem.</p>

<p>Hardy said that if he could be assured of getting some
satisfactory discussions on Monday, he would be glad to wait
until that day for official word from Rusk.</p>

<p>Rusk’s letter of Monday, March 13, stated:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span></p>

<p>“The Department shares with you a deep concern that
the foreign aid programs which are so important to the success
of our foreign policy, should be administered effectively
and in a manner that is above reproach.</p>

<p>“I have therefore directed the officers of the Department
concerned to co-operate fully with you and your staff to expedite
your investigation and to make available to you all
information and documents relevant to your inquiry which
we properly can.”</p>

<p>Chairman Hardy took Secretary Rusk at his word and
assumed that records would be made available. The next
morning Hardy called Assistant Secretary Brooks Hays to
inform him that a staff investigator would be visiting the
office of the Inspector General and Comptroller with instructions
to talk to personnel in that office. He asked that Hays
do what he could to assure that Investigator Walton Woods
receive a co-operative reception.</p>

<p>However, when Woods showed up at the office of Acting
Inspector General James E. Nugent and asked to speak with
Investigator Michael J. Ambrose he was refused permission.
Nugent said that as far as he was concerned the orders under
the Eisenhower administration were still in force, but that
he would check with Legal Counsel Chayes to see if there
had been a change. Later Woods returned to Nugent’s office
and was informed by Nugent that no files or documents from
the Office of the Inspector General were to be made available
to the subcommittee.</p>

<p>Chairman Hardy was amazed that the same roadblocks
continued to exist. On March 16, 1961, he again wrote Rusk
relating what had happened and commenting:</p>

<p>“In spite of these developments I cannot believe that this
administration is disposed to adhere to the withholding policies
of the prior administration.”</p>

<p>Then Hardy let Rusk know that despite all the roadblocks
put in the way of the subcommittee, information had already<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>
been obtained that raised serious questions about the operation
of the ICA policing system.</p>

<p>“The data which we have already assembled independently
give us reason to question whether either the Office of
the Inspector General and Comptroller or its predecessor
organization has performed in a satisfactory manner,” Hardy
wrote.</p>

<p>“An office like this, exercising as it does an internal watchdog
function, is of particular concern to a subcommittee such
as ours. For when the Congress can be assured that such an
office is doing a good job, then the areas where independent
congressional inquiry may be required become fewer and
smaller, and the work of Congress is accordingly simplified.
Certainly we cannot evaluate the work of this office [OIGC]
in any particular, if we are not permitted full access to its
files and interviews with its personnel.”</p>

<p>When Chairman Hardy called a hearing five days later on
March 21, the witnesses showed up with letters of instructions
flatly barring testimony. Secretary of State Rusk supplied
each witness with the form letter prohibiting free
testimony “concerning the conduct of the foreign aid program
in Peru.</p>

<p>“I am writing this letter to instruct you that you are not
authorized to testify concerning the contents of any files of
the International Cooperation Administration or the Office of
the Inspector General and Comptroller in the Department of
State which relates to an investigation into charges of misconduct
on the part of individuals or corporate persons or,
more generally, to testify concerning any matter involved in
such an investigation carried on by the International Cooperation
Administration or the Office of the Inspector General
and Comptroller in the Department of State.”</p>

<p>So this was what the Kennedy administration called “co-operation”
to “expedite your investigation and to make available
to you all information and documents relevant to your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>
inquiry which we properly can.” Chairman Hardy had hoped
for better, but concluded that it was time to end the polite
letter writing and get down to tough talk.</p>

<p>“Until this morning,” he declared, “it was my sincere hope
that we would see some real improvement.”</p>

<p>Hardy had been frustrated for a full year in his effort to
gain access to the key documents on foreign aid in Peru. And
the Kennedy administration, in office already two months,
had done nothing to change the system that covered up for
the dishonest and the incompetent people who wasted
foreign-aid funds. Worse yet, it developed that twelve witnesses
Hardy called in carried identical letters of instructions
from Rusk to refuse to testify or produce records on any investigations
conducted by ICA.</p>

<p>Hardy denounced the Rusk letter as “the most arrogant
instruction” ever given to government witnesses. Representative
George Meader declared that “a curtain had been rung
down” on the operations of the ICA.</p>

<p>Meader, the highest ranking Republican on the Hardy subcommittee,
demanded that Secretary Rusk should be brought
before the subcommittee to explain the barriers he was erecting
against investigations by Congress.</p>

<p>When Chairman Hardy agreed to call Rusk the very next
day, State Department officials said “it would be very difficult”
for Rusk to appear at that time for he was leaving the
following evening for Bangkok and a major international conference
of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization nations.</p>

<p>Hardy declared that Rusk would be summoned before the
subcommittee when he returned from the international conference,
and that in the meantime he would be calling all
other responsible State Department officials in an effort to
get to the bottom of the stalling.</p>

<p>For the record, he reviewed the long struggle to get information
on the Peru program from the Eisenhower administration.
He also related the details of the patient two-month<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>
wait to give the Kennedy administration sufficient time to
examine the problem carefully.</p>

<p>Then, to light a fire under the issue, Chairman Hardy disclosed
enough information to make it obvious that he was on
the trail of multimillion-dollar scandals in the handling of
foreign aid in Peru. He revealed that 2 million dollars in U.S.
funds were spent on a farm-to-market highway which led
only to unarable mountainous land. It was started before
plans were completed, plans were changed while it was being
constructed, and the funds ran out when it was only half
finished.</p>

<p>He also told about an irrigation project built at Pampas
de Noco. It cost $125,000 of Americans’ money, but it didn’t
work because there simply was not enough water available
in the area to make use of the projected irrigation works.</p>

<p>John R. Neale, director of the United States Operations
Mission in Peru, had acquired a $200,000 interest in a ranching
corporation that received aid under the U.S. program.
Although Neale had resigned in 1958, there were indications
that key ICA and State Department personnel had protected
him from a thorough investigation for months.</p>

<p>Hardy revealed widespread irregularities in the 14-million-dollar
drought relief program in Peru. He had testimony that
as much as 60 per cent of the so-called “drought relief” went
into unauthorized channels and was no help to the drought
victims.</p>

<p>Chairman Hardy made certain that President Kennedy
was apprised of the nature of the mismanagement and fraud
being hidden by the State Department. The reaction was
fast, and the Rusk letter of instructions was slapped down
by the White House on direct orders from President
Kennedy.</p>

<p>Brooks Hays, the former congressman and Assistant Secretary
of State for Congressional Relations, assured Chairman<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span>
Hardy that the Rusk instructions would be rescinded, the
documents released, and witnesses freed to testify.</p>

<p>Witnesses called by Hardy a week later, on March 29, did
testify freely. These witnesses produced a letter from State
Department Legal Counsel Abram J. Chayes instructing
them to forget the whole thing. Chayes wrote:</p>

<p>“The instructions contained in the letter of March 21,
1961, addressed to you by Secretary of State Dean Rusk, are
hereby withdrawn. In view of this fact, I would appreciate it
if you would return the letter to me and treat it as though
it had not been sent.”</p>

<p>Nothing that Chayes could write, however, could erase
from some people’s minds the memory of this clumsy and
arrogant effort of the State Department to withhold. To ensure
its perpetuity, Representative Meader rose on the House
floor two weeks later, on April 17, to recite the story for the
<cite>Congressional Record</cite>.</p>

<p>“In recent years, ambitious bureaucrats have concocted
and promoted the so-called doctrine of ‘executive privilege,’
which, in my judgment, is a myth,” Meader said. “In my
view, there is no right or power in the executive branch of
the Government to decide what facts Congress needs concerning
the conduct of the public business.... That decision
is clearly and properly a legislative decision.”</p>

<p>Meader declared that “the struggle between bureaucrats
who wish to hide their activities and committees of Congress
insisting on access to complete and accurate information
concerning public business ... has not received the attention
it merits.”</p>

<p>The Michigan congressman was a Republican, to be sure,
but he was one of a handful who could not be accused of
playing partisan politics with this issue. No man in Congress
insisted any more aggressively than George Meader that the
Eisenhower administration make records available to the
public, to Congress and the General Accounting Office.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>
When Meader quoted President Kennedy’s January 30 address
on the state of the Union, he did not do so in a malicious
or partisan manner.</p>

<p>Kennedy had said: “For my part, I shall withhold from
neither the Congress nor the people, any fact or report, past,
present or future, which is necessary for an informed judgment
of our conduct and hazards.”</p>

<p>“I wish this sentence could be printed in capital letters
in the <cite>Congressional Record</cite>,” Meader said. “Many of us
welcomed that clear, forthright statement as heralding a new
policy in the executive branch of the Government with respect
to furnishing information to congressional committees
on request.”</p>

<p>Representative Meader was not critical of President Kennedy
for the delays on Peru, for President Kennedy had personally
overridden his Secretary of State. But Meader was
wary of the future.</p>

<p>“As the bureaus and agencies in the executive branch of
the Government have grown in number, and in power,” he
said, “there has been a parallel growth in their efforts to
shroud in secrecy the manner in which they discharge their
stewardship of the public authority and moneys entrusted to
them.”</p>

<p>Meader declared that “the question remained whether
that laudable generality [in President Kennedy’s address of
January 30] would be actually carried out in practice” or
whether there would be “procrastination and recalcitrance
on the part of officials.”</p>

<p>Within two weeks of the March 29, 1961, showdown,
the Hardy subcommittee was receiving the documents on
the U.S. aid program in Peru. These were the documents, the
release of which Attorney General William P. Rogers had
said “would gravely impair the proper functioning and administration
of the executive branch of the Government.”</p>

<p>What the reports did do was to document fully the sloppy,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>
wasteful, and corrupt administration of foreign aid in Peru.</p>

<p>From the outset the Peru drought relief program had been
riddled with irregularities. There were shipments of 106,000
tons of grain meant to be sold to help needy drought victims
but which were sold, without authorization, to pay administrative
costs, port charges, and inland transportation costs.
Above all, the grain was not meant to be sold, as it was, for
the profiteering of grain millers in Peru. It wasn’t to be sold
to raise money to buy houses to be sold to influential Peruvians
at less than cost.</p>

<p>The mismanagement of the program was so raw that it
hadn’t completely escaped detection in Washington. A desk
officer in 1957 had figured that only 12,000 tons of the first
45,000 tons had been accounted for and asked: “Who received
the rest of the grain?”</p>

<p>No one answered his question, however, either in the
Washington ICA office or at the Embassy in Peru. When a
Washington auditor was finally sent to Peru, he found that
no end-use checks had been made by the United States Operations
Mission (USOM). He stated:</p>

<p>“The lone USOM auditor, a local employee, stated that
USOM officials issued orders that no checks were to be made
beyond the offices of the committees selling [drought aid]
foods. Thus, end users were not contacted and no determination
could be made as to the proper utilization of food.”</p>

<p>Within the State Department and the ICA no aggressive
action was taken to find out whether there was any substance
to the complaints of conflicts of interest, waste, and major
misuse of funds. Lethargy, incompetence, excuses, and cover-up
prevailed.</p>

<p>When Dr. Raymond C. Gibson, an employee of the Office
of Education, returned from an official visit in Peru, he
called attention of high officials of ICA to the activities of
John R. Neale, head of the USOM in Peru, who had a large
interest in a farm receiving benefits of ICA funds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span></p>

<p>Instead of investigating Neale’s holdings, top ICA officials
characterized Gibson’s complaint as “character assassination.”
The officials did assign an investigator to the case but
told him to “assure Neale of our belief in his integrity.”</p>

<p>Within a few months, the case had become known within
ICA not as the Neale case, but the Gibson case. ICA started
a full field background investigation of Dr. Gibson, and one
official pledged to hold Dr. Gibson to “full accountability”
for filing a complaint against Neale.</p>

<p>The ICA investigators overlooked information in the ICA
files which disclosed that Neale’s family had an interest in a
Peru ranch. Continued complaints finally forced ICA hearings
on Neale in 1958, but even then his character witnesses
included the American Ambassador to Peru, Theodore Achilles,
and Rollin S. Atwood, regional director of the Office of
Latin-American Operations of the ICA.</p>

<p>“When Achilles and Atwood appeared before the ICA
hearing board as character witnesses for Neale, they seemed
more concerned with the motivations of the complainants
than they were with the truth of their allegation,” the report
of the Hardy subcommittee stated.</p>

<p>“The high position of Neale and the high position of his
uncritical supporters, Atwood and Achilles, somewhat cowed
the investigators assigned to this case.</p>

<p>“At the time of his removal, Neale had been affiliated with
the Bazo Corporation [the ranching operation] for over eight
years, and for at least four of those years ICA had in its
possession sufficient information to warrant an investigation
which ... would have turned up the basic facts.</p>

<p>“It was congressional intervention that precipitated the
Guinane investigation”—the final investigation that brought
about Neale’s resignation.</p>

<p>“All employees of ICA seem to know, without being specifically
instructed,” the subcommittee report went on, “that
the preferred policy of the agency, and the Embassy in this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>
instance, is to brush this sort of instance under the rug, with
a quiet ‘resignation’ or ‘retirement.’”</p>

<p>“Although the old office of Personnel Security and Integrity
in ICA was primarily responsible for the ineffective investigation
in the Neale case, its successor, OIGC, did not
perform with any more credit in a related matter.”</p>

<p>The ICA had used “executive privilege” to cover up its
failures for several years. Instead of learning from past failures,
the agency continued its negligence with full confidence
that “executive privilege” could hide the failures from
Congress, the General Accounting Office and the public.</p>

<p>The details of the scandals had not been known to President
Eisenhower, nor had he known of the incredible laxity
in the investigative units in the ICA. However, by promoting
a secrecy cloak for the investigators of ICA he had allowed
the ICA to hide the major defects in a vital part of an agency
administering approximately 4 billion dollars a year.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII<br>
<span class="fs150">A Pending Problem for JFK</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">In its first year, the Kennedy administration had tackled the
problem of secrecy with noble thoughts and brave deeds.
President Kennedy could not have spoken more clearly on
the need for open government in a democratic society.
Moreover, he had followed up his words with stringent action
by overruling Secretary of State Dean Rusk on the one occasion
when the State Department had tried to hide records
behind a claim of “executive privilege.”</p>

<p>Chairman Edward Hebert said that his Armed Services
subcommittee was receiving better co-operation than it had
ever received from the Defense Department. Hebert had
talked with President Kennedy and been assured that the
administration felt it needed the help and prodding of a
committee of Congress to cut the billions in wasteful defense
spending.</p>

<p>The investigations by Chairman Porter Hardy were proceeding
on the same note of co-operation, and the Virginia
Democrat said he was “hopeful that it will continue.” Chairman
Hardy’s subcommittee had a number of investigations
of foreign aid under way, and he believed that some of these
investigations would be a real test of the sincerity and consistency
of the Kennedy administration stand on “executive
privilege.”</p>

<p>Though many good signs indicated the Kennedy administration
meant what it said about an open information policy,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span>
there were other signs that did not augur so well. Perhaps
the most important was President Kennedy’s personal sensitivity
to criticism and his inclination to try to punish those
he regarded as being “enemies” or unfairly critical.</p>

<p>The President himself had telephoned reporters and editors
to complain about stories he considered unfair or unfavorable
to him or his administration. At one time, the
reporters for <cite>Time</cite> magazine were cut off from contact with
White House sources on a direct order from the President.
The order was lifted in about two weeks, after President
Kennedy and his assistants felt <cite>Time’s</cite> reporters and editors
had been given a lesson.</p>

<p>Other persons in the White House behaved even tougher,
threatening retaliation against reporters they felt had done
them damage. Lloyd Norman, Pentagon correspondent for
<cite>Newsweek</cite> magazine, became the target of an FBI investigation
when he beat his colleagues with an exclusive report on
the alternative plans for action on the Berlin crisis. The investigation
was instigated despite the fact that before publication
the report was read by a high White House figure who
raised no question as to the propriety of printing it.</p>

<p>A memorandum by Frederick G. Dutton, Special Assistant
to the President, contained language on government information
policies that “shocked” Representative John Moss.
The Dutton memorandum of July 20, 1961, was attached to
a Civil Service Commission statement on standards of conduct
for government employees. It stated:</p>

<p>“Employees may not disclose official information without
either appropriate general or specific authority under agency
regulations.”</p>

<p>Congressman Moss asked the White House for a “complete
reversal” of the statement, plus a “positive directive to
all employees to honor the people’s right to know as a routine
matter in the conduct of government business.</p>

<p>“This restrictive attitude expressed by this [Dutton] language<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span>
is a complete reversal of all of the policies which the
House government information subcommittee has supported
for many years,” Moss wrote to Dutton. “It is also a direct
contradiction of the clear position which President Kennedy
has taken....”</p>

<p>The White House immediately withdrew the Dutton
memorandum and asserted the right of the people to be informed
about government operations. The incident nevertheless
underscored the need for constant vigilance to prevent
directives that in substance tell government employees to
keep their mouths shut.</p>

<p>At the Pentagon there were also a few unhealthy signs that
bore watching. Defense Secretary Robert Strange McNamara
was generally praised as a bright, able, and hard-working
public official, but his performance in the information
area did not elicit equally laudatory comments. Though McNamara’s
press chief, Assistant Secretary of Defense Arthur
Sylvester, had served for years as a reporter in the Washington
Bureau of the Newark <cite>News</cite>, he was sharply critical of
the press in his first months in office. He did little to smooth
the road for the Defense Secretary or to educate McNamara’s
attitudes on freedom of information.</p>

<p>Testimony released in May 1961 by the Senate Committee
on Armed Services disclosed that McNamara appeared to
favor less information for the public as well as misinformation
on our military developments.</p>

<p>“Why should we tell Russia that the Zeus development
may not be satisfactory?” McNamara asked the Armed Services
Committee. “What we ought to be saying is that we
have the most perfect anti-ICBM system that the human
mind will ever devise. Instead, the public domain is already
full of statements that the Zeus may not be satisfactory, that
it has deficiencies. I think it is absurd to release that kind of
information.”</p>

<p>The McNamara statement was met with immediate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>
criticism from Representative John E. Moss, chairman of
the House Government Information Subcommittee. Moss, a
Democrat, declared that McNamara’s testimony was “a gross
disservice” to the people of the United States and inconsistent
with views expressed by President Kennedy. He asked
how the McNamara statement could be reconciled with
President Kennedy’s pledge to “withhold from neither the
Congress nor the people any fact or report, past, present or
future, which is necessary for an informed judgment of our
conduct and hazards.”</p>

<p>Representative Moss declared that “advocacy of a program
of misinformation constitutes a grave disservice to a nation
already confused and suffering from informational malnutrition.
To claim perfection in a weapon system, thereby
creating a false sense of security, only results in complacency
complained about by the very officials who would further
feed it.”</p>

<p>McNamara, Moss said, “expressed an attitude which while
not new is nevertheless most alarming.”</p>

<p>In the face of a barrage of similar criticism, the Defense
Department hurriedly released a statement that McNamara
did not mean to mislead the American people but only the
Russians.</p>

<p>At his press conference on May 26, 1961, the Defense Secretary
issued a four-point statement to serve as a guide on
information policy. McNamara, forty-four-year-old Phi Beta
Kappa and a former assistant professor of business administration
at Harvard, had learned at least what his published
position must be.</p>

<p>“In a democratic society,” his clarification began, “the
public must be kept informed of the major issues in our national
defense policy.”</p>

<p>While pointing out the need to avoid disclosure of information
that might aid our potential enemies, he declared it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>
“is equally important to avoid overclassification. I suggest
that we follow this principle: When in doubt underclassify.”</p>

<p>The Defense Secretary also said that public statements
must reflect the policy of the Defense Department, and that
Defense personnel should not discuss “foreign policy subjects,
a field which is reserved for the President and the Secretary
of State.”</p>

<p>Representative Moss commended Defense Secretary McNamara
for “recognition of the people’s right to know.” He
singled out for praise the McNamara comment that “the
public has at least as much right to bad news as good news.”
However, he reserved judgment on the instructions restricting
comment on policy matters. Moss asked to be advised on
all directives or other instructions used in implementing the
general information policy. He had learned by now that fine
policy statements can mask the most intolerable withholding
of information.</p>

<p>The reasonableness of the general policy statements on
Defense information could hardly be criticized, but complaints
were beginning to be heard about a tightening of
curbs on speeches by military officers and about the difficulty
of access to personnel at the Pentagon.</p>

<p><cite>The Navy Times</cite>, a private publication, commented:</p>

<p>“Americans generally ought to be having some misgivings
over the current trend at the Pentagon. There’s an air of
secrecy, of censorship, of arbitrary rulings.”</p>

<p>The Defense Department toyed with the idea of invoking
“executive privilege” when two committees of Congress initiated
investigations of shipments of strategic materials to
various Iron Curtain countries. The Internal Security Subcommittee
of the Senate and a House Select Committee on
Export Control were embarking on a repetition of the East-West
trade investigations that Robert Kennedy, then a committee
lawyer, had directed five years earlier. As Attorney<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>
General, Robert Kennedy advised against the use of “executive
privilege.”</p>

<p>Despite assurances that the Kennedy administration
would not claim “executive privilege,” Chairman Porter
Hardy wanted the law to state that reports of the Inspector
General and Comptroller on foreign-aid administration
would be made available to Congress and the General Accounting
Office (GAO) auditors. Promises were fine, but
Chairman Hardy wanted a firm law to bolster his subcommittee’s
authority to obtain records on foreign-aid spending.</p>

<p>Hardy’s amendment to the foreign-aid legislation of 1961
provided that if the Inspector General and Comptroller
failed to make information available to Congress and the
GAO auditors, their funds would be cut off by GAO. The
House gave the amendment overwhelming support.</p>

<p>The Senate, however—with support from the Kennedy
administration—emasculated the Hardy amendment by adding
what Representative George Meader described as the
“Presidential escape clause.” This clause provided that the
Executive can avoid furnishing information on foreign-aid
expenditures upon a “certification by the President that he
has forbidden the furnishing thereof pursuant to such request
and his reason for so doing.”</p>

<p>Representatives Hardy and Meader remembered the experience
with a similar escape clause that was attached to
the foreign-aid legislation of 1959. It had enabled President
Eisenhower simply to sign a certification in order to bar
Senate and House investigators from every key record they
sought dealing with mismanagement of the foreign-aid program.
The proof of the weakness of a law with such an escape
clause had caused the Congress to pass the tight Hardy
amendment in 1960. Although President Eisenhower defied
the specific intent of the Hardy amendment by hiding the
Peru foreign-aid records, the 1960 provisions had been considered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>
strong enough for a court test if Eisenhower had
remained in office.</p>

<p>The Kennedy administration’s support of the “Presidential
escape clause” in the 1961 legislation was a bad omen to
Representative Meader.</p>

<p>“The effect of the Presidential escape clause ...” he said,
“is to weaken existing law and to diminish the power the
Congress enjoyed during [the last year of] the Eisenhower
administration to obtain information from the Executive of
foreign aid expenditures.</p>

<p>“This constitutes a victory for the bureaucrats, a defeat
for Congress, and a serious setback in the fight against government
secrecy.”</p>

<p>Criticism of the Kennedy administration from some Republicans
could be disregarded. But from George Meader it
invited serious attention. As the foregoing chapters have
shown, he was one of the most outspoken critics of the information
policies of the Eisenhower administration.</p>

<p>Meader had joined Representative Hardy, a Democrat, in
criticizing the State Department in March when Secretary
of State Rusk issued orders barring the Hardy committee
from testimony or records on the Peru scandals. But he had
also joined Hardy in applauding President Kennedy for overruling
his own Secretary of State and making the ICA records
on Peru foreign-aid scandals available to the Hardy subcommittee.</p>

<p>On July 28, 1961, the Democratic-controlled House Government
Operations Committee issued a report on information
policies. It was, of course, highly critical of the
Eisenhower administration but not completely approving of
the new administration. The committee found the record of
the first months of the Kennedy administration “mixed.”
However, it saw a “hopeful note” in the fact that President
Kennedy had given “positive policy direction from the top.”
The report contained a favorable comment on “the Presidential<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>
determination—even at the cost of reversing his Secretary
of State—to live up to the new administration’s pledge
to honor the right to know.”</p>

<p>Democrats took great party pride in the speeches President
Kennedy made to assure the public of his concern for
freedom of information.</p>

<p>“The essence of free communication must be that our failures
as well as our successes will be broadcast around the
world,” President Kennedy said at the convention of the National
Association of Broadcasters. “And therefore we take
double pride in our successes.</p>

<p>“The great inner resource of freedom, the resource which
has kept the world’s oldest democracy continuously young
and vital, the resource which has always brought us our
greatest exploits in time of our greatest need, is the very fact
of the open society.</p>

<p>“Thus, if we are once again to preserve our civilization,
it will be because of our freedom, and not in spite of it....
For the flow of ideas, the capacity to make informed choices,
the ability to criticize, all the assumptions upon which political
democracy rests, depends largely upon communication.”</p>

<p>By the time the House Government Operations Committee
was ready to file a second report on government information
policies, the Democrats were aglow with admiration for
President Kennedy. The September 21, 1961, report stated:
“For the first time since the subcommittee entered the fight
against excessive Government secrecy six years ago, there is
a powerful new weapon—the support of a President who is
clearly on record in favor of the greatest flow of Government
information.”</p>

<p>Representative Meader thought the Democrats were too
willing to praise a Democratic administration. In his dissent,
he wrote:</p>

<p>“I cannot subscribe to the majority report because in my
judgment it has political overtones and accepts the self-serving<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>
declarations of officials in the new administration
rather than actual performance as indicating an improvement
in the attitude of the executive branch toward providing
information to the Congress and the public.</p>

<p>“The majority condemns the Eisenhower administration
record on secrecy in government while praising that of the
Kennedy administration. Such a distinction in my opinion,
is not justified.”</p>

<p>Meader well remembered the fine words spoken in 1952
and 1953 on same subject by officials of the Eisenhower
administration. He knew that the true test of the Kennedy
administration lay not with words but with the administration’s
continued willingness to support the power of inquiry
of the Congress.</p>

<p>A few days after the release of the House report and
Meader’s dissent, Attorney General Kennedy upheld the importance
of investigations by Congress.</p>

<p>On the “Meet the Press” television show on September 24,
James Reston, Bureau Chief for The New York <cite>Times</cite>, said to
Attorney General Kennedy:</p>

<p>“In the field of ‘executive privilege’ ... you seem more
willing than previous Presidents and administrations to give
information sought by Congress.”</p>

<p>“As far as ‘executive privilege’ is concerned,” the Attorney
General answered, “I was associated with a congressional
committee for five or six years and had battles with the executive
branch of the government regarding obtaining information.</p>

<p>“I think it is terribly important to insure that the executive
branch of the government is not corrupt and that they are
efficient, that the legislative branch of the government has
the ability to check on what we are doing in the executive
branch of the government.</p>

<p>“So, in every instance that has been brought to our attention
in the Department of Justice so far by various departments<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span>
of the executive branch where this question has
been raised we have suggested and recommended that they
make the information available to Congress. We will continue
to do that. I don’t say that there might not be an instance
where ‘executive privilege’ might be used, but I think
it is terribly important that the executive branch of the government,
as powerful and strong as it is, that there be some
check and balance on it, and in the last analysis the group
that can best check and insure that it is handling its affairs
properly is the Congress of the United States, so we will lean
over backwards to make sure that they get the information
they request.”</p>

<p>There was no reason to doubt the sincerity of the youthful
Attorney General, and in fact there was every reason to believe
he meant what he said. He was speaking from personal
experience, he seemed to speak with conviction, and it was
not yet time to be posturing for the 1964 political campaign.</p>

<p>It was, of course, relatively easy to take a broad view at
this time when opening records could only expose crimes or
mismanagement that had developed when the Eisenhower
administration was in power. It would take more courage and
great understanding of government to open records that
might expose a trusted Kennedy subordinate or embarrass
the Kennedy administration.</p>

<p>Barely more than a year after the Kennedy administration
had taken office, a situation arose which raised grave question
as to what its long-range policy would be. In February
1962, during the hearings on alleged muzzling of military
officers, President Kennedy invoked the claim of “executive
privilege” at the request of Defense Secretary Robert McNamara.
McNamara wished to avoid identifying for the
Senate Preparedness Subcommittee the Pentagon officials
who had censored specific speeches by high military officers.</p>

<p>President Kennedy’s letter to McNamara of February 8,
1962 (see Appendix D), set out an ill-defined claim that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span>
national interest was at stake. The letter contained some
terminology that seemed to claim an absolute right to bar
testimony before Congress by any subordinate career officials.
It was attacked by Senator Strom Thurmond, the South
Carolina Democrat, as a “dangerous” precedent that would
have barred Congress from investigating the Pearl Harbor
disaster or obtaining information on a wide variety of
scandals.</p>

<p>Many political writers excused President Kennedy. Some
pointed to language in the letter they said indicated that he
was not setting a broad precedent but was merely shutting
off an investigation they considered to be senseless. Representative
Moss declared that the Senate subcommittee had
the legal right to ask the questions to determine which censors
had blue-penciled which speeches.</p>

<p>It was not clear immediately whether the February 8 letter
was to be an isolated incident or a troublesome broad precedent
for more arbitrary secrecy in the tradition of the May
17, 1954, Eisenhower letter.</p>

<span class="fs150">A Solution</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">History establishes that any administration may be afflicted
with laxity, incompetence, and even outright fraud. History
has also taught that any administration can harbor men who
want to hide mistakes and corruption.</p>

<p>It is true that no President has been directly involved in
fraudulent activity, and it seems unlikely that any ever will
be. Holding such a high office would inspire almost any man
to rise above the desire for personal enrichment, particularly
if the cost might be damaging to his place in history. But
any President might be tempted to hide records on a claim
of “executive privilege” if he felt he could save some trusted
subordinate from the slings of the opposition political party.</p>

<p>In varying degrees, our Presidents have been dependent
upon a palace guard. The nature of the position, with all its
vast responsibilities, makes a circle of close advisers inevitable.
Thus Presidents of the past have sought information
about alleged improprieties or corruptions from the very men
who have been accused of perpetrating them. Instead of facts
and a clear analysis of the problem—whether it was Teapot
Dome, tax scandals, or Dixon-Yates—the Presidents have received
misinformation and excuses. The accusations have
been explained away to our Presidents as partisan complaints
from politicians maliciously bent on destroying the administration’s
programs. Such explanations from palace guards
unfortunately have been all too effective and have obscured<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>
the facts that would have alerted our Presidents to conflicts
of interest, favoritism, and fraud.</p>

<p>President Kennedy and future Presidents will face the
same kind of pitfalls. Regardless of their own integrity, they
cannot be expected to conduct personal investigations of
each of their subordinates. The Presidents and the people
must therefore depend upon investigations from outside the
executive branch—by the Congress and the General Accounting
Office—for an aggressive search for the facts.</p>

<p>Investigations by Congress have demonstrated the failure
of the military departments to police themselves effectively
from the inside. In every recent year, the Congress and the
GAO have pinpointed the waste of hundreds of millions of
dollars on inefficient, incompetent, or corrupt handling of
Defense contract arrangements.</p>

<p>Examination of testimony on the foreign-aid programs in
Laos and Peru shows that the State Department is little better
than the Defense Department in rooting out mismanagement
and corruption. There are dozens of other areas within
the bureaucracy where the record is just as bad.</p>

<p>It is doubtful that we will ever eliminate corruption in the
federal government, but it must be kept under closer control
or it can spread with devastating impact. Nothing speeds
the growth of corruption more than policies that foster arbitrary
secrecy. Secrecy allows little scandals to become major
scandals, costly to the taxpayers, devastating to our foreign-aid
program, to our position of defense readiness, and to our
national morale.</p>

<p>“Secrecy,” as the House Government Operations Committee
has put it, “is the handmaiden of bureaucracy, especially
military bureaucracy. It has so pervasive an effect that all
government becomes invested with the urge to restrict—even
those routine agencies which should be wide open to the
public.”</p>

<p>In these pages, I have not attempted to examine every<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span>
agency of government. I have examined enough, however,
to show how severe the infection of secrecy has become, what
dire symptoms it produces, and how seriously it threatens
the health of our democracy.</p>

<p>It can be wiped out. As treatment for a permanent cure, I
suggest the following steps:</p>

<p>1 <span style="padding-left: 1em"><em>All officials except the President should be obligated
to explain all their actions to Congress and the General Accounting
Office, unless specific laws are passed for withholding
information.</em> This does not mean that the public or
Congress should have access to all papers when a decision is
pending, but at a later date Congress should have access to
all records and testimony concerning events leading up to
the executive decisions.</span></p>

<p>A good example from recent history that shows the value
of a properly conducted hearing was the Senate investigation
of President Truman’s firing of General Douglas MacArthur
in 1951.</p>

<p>The special Senate committee—selected with a reasonably
even division of political forces from the Armed Services and
Foreign Relations committees—did not seek testimony from
President Truman. However, it did require the testimony of
General Omar Bradley, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff. Bradley testified on all events leading up to the firing,
including his meeting with President Truman. Bradley was
not asked to recount verbatim his discussion with President
Truman, but he testified he met with President Truman, that
the MacArthur actions were discussed, and the decision was
made by President Truman to fire General MacArthur.</p>

<p>The special Senate committee met behind closed doors but
released a daily transcript of testimony that had been examined
to eliminate any matter that might violate national
military security standards.</p>

<p>Had the Eisenhower administration’s doctrine of “executive
privilege” prevailed at that time, a total secrecy blanket<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span>
could have been thrown around the Defense Department,
the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the White House. There would
have been no way of determining the facts leading up to the
decision, except as the President found it convenient to reveal
them.</p>

<p>How much better it was for all concerned that the MacArthur
firing was carefully examined and that the public
was apprised of all the material facts.</p>

<p>2 <span style="padding-left: 1em"><em>Congress should enact special laws to cover the specific
areas in which withholding of records is deemed necessary
to the public good.</em> There are now laws that provide for
withholding of federal income tax information from the public,
and from all committees of Congress except certain ones
with supervisory jurisdiction over the Internal Revenue Service.
Laws have been enacted providing for withholding of
Defense information that involves national security. Other
areas—FBI reports, patent secrets, business reports, or personnel
files—could be covered by special legislation of a similar
nature, but modified to meet the requirements of the area
in which the withholding is needed.</span></p>

<p>3 <span style="padding-left: 1em"><em>Congress should provide stiff criminal penalties for use
against government officials who withhold information from
properly authorized committees of Congress or the GAO.</em>
This legislation should also provide the mechanism for prosecution
to be initiated by the Congress or the GAO. Such a
mechanism is necessary to avoid the situation wherein an
Attorney General, advocate for the President and appointed
by the President, simply refuses to enforce the law or gives
patently false legal opinions to avoid enforcement.</span></p>

<p>4 <span style="padding-left: 1em"><em>The Congress should establish an effective means for
systematic review of papers carrying national security classifications
of “confidential,” “secret,” or “top secret.” Or the
President could establish a small committee to spot-check,
review, and challenge questionable use of national security
classifications.</em> However the review group is set up, its members<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span>
should be selected from outside the military field, and
they should be persons with a strong and responsible interest
in open government. They should have authority to challenge
arbitrary or questionable security classifications and
authority to obtain explanations from all persons with a role
in questionable classifications.</span></p>

<p>This review group should not have the power to change
classifications, only the power to recommend changes. It
should have the authority, however, to file reports with Congress,
with department heads, and with the President that
could be made public. Such reports should identify individuals
engaged in arbitrary or questionable overclassification,
as well as those responsible for failing to take steps to declassify.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Only through the establishment of these checks on executive
secrecy can the public be assured that laws are administered
in the way that the Congress intended them to be. Only
in this way can the public be certain that the laws are not
twisted or disregarded by an arbitrary bureaucracy operating
in secret.</p>

<p>And what about checks upon possible abuses by the investigating
committees of Congress? There are many. The
courts offer some of the most effective. Rulings in recent
years have put limitations on the power of an investigating
committee. The committee must be properly authorized by
the House or Senate, with a specific authority, and it must
operate within the scope of that authority. The courts will
not uphold a contempt citation if a committee of Congress
is operating outside its proper authority, or if the questions
asked are not pertinent to the inquiry. Recent rulings have
held that the committee chairman must also explain to the
witness the reasons why the questions are pertinent and necessary
to carry out the legislative function.</p>

<p>In addition to these legal limitations, committees of Congress<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>
are held in check by their own bipartisanship and the
fact that they usually operate in the public view. The members
of the committees nearly always represent a cross section
of the Congress, everything from extreme liberals to extreme
conservatives with many gradations between. This representation
assures a spokesman for almost every point of view. It
also assures cross examination of witnesses in most cases, for
minority counsel is normally provided to help minority
members bring out facts that the majority may choose to
overlook or minimize.</p>

<p>In recent years, most committees have adopted rules of
procedure to assure some element of fair play. Since most
hearings are held in public, there is the opportunity for the
press and other interested groups and individuals to view
the questioning and to point out any lapses in fair play.</p>

<p>Open congressional hearings do not absolutely assure fair
play, but they do represent the best practical means this
country has so far devised for assuring the public’s right to
know about the running of its government.</p>

<p>It is pertinent to note here that in England, which is
generally regarded by political authorities as a model for
democratic procedures, the need for constant inquiry into
governmental policies and administration of the laws is fully
recognized.</p>

<p>The British Government, unlike ours, is totally responsible
to the Parliament, with the Prime Minister and other ministers
coming out of the Parliament. This system has resulted
in the development of a number of devices to accomplish the
same basic purpose that our congressional investigations
should accomplish.</p>

<p>There is a “question time” in Parliament four days a week
during which any member of the House of Commons may
interrogate the various ministers and even the Prime Minister.
This periodic opportunity for questioning makes it possible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span>
for the opposition either to obtain immediate answers
or to demonstrate evasiveness on crucial issues.</p>

<p>Also the Parliament is free to investigate through select
committees of the House of Commons which are unlimited
in their power to compel testimony and production of records
and to punish for contempt. The contempt can be punished
by jailing by the Parliament for the duration of the term,
and British courts have left this power unlimited over the
years.</p>

<p>The “question time” and select committees are supplemented
by Royal Commissions of Inquiry, technically established
and appointed by the Crown and Tribunals of Inquiry,
established by the Parliament with members named by the
Crown.</p>

<p>The Royal Commissions have had no power to compel
testimony and production of records. However, co-operation
is usually obtained because of the pressure of British public
opinion, as well as the ever-present threat that a select committee
of the Commons can take jurisdiction and use its contempt
powers to force testimony.</p>

<p>The Tribunals of Inquiry operate with the normal court
powers of subpoena and oaths to compel testimony. This is
a device for taking an inquiry out of the partisan political
atmosphere of a legislative investigation.</p>

<p>In the United States the question is often asked whether
greater congressional freedom in questioning officials of the
executive branch would not interfere with the efficiency of
the government. Much of the business of federal government
is simply keeping records and preparing testimony to
account for the custodianship of the government agencies. In
most instances it would take an official far less time to go
before a committee of Congress and give a frank account of
the activities of his agency than it has taken to devise cover-ups
for frauds, mismanagement, and embarrassing oversights.</p>

<p>The Teapot Dome scandals could have been fully disclosed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span>
in a few months instead of several years. The details of some
of the Truman tax scandals could have been uncovered in a
few weeks. And again, a frank accounting could have explained
the Dixon-Yates contract in a matter of days.</p>

<p>Congress can be of great service to a cabinet officer in
keeping his agency clean. If a congressional committee is
unreasonable, or brutal, or oversteps its jurisdiction, such
abuses, it must be remembered, take place in public where
they can be seen and remedied. The President and others in
the executive branch have the personnel and facilities for
pointing out the abuses so they can be eradicated in the face
of public opinion.</p>

<p>Ours was designed to be a government of laws, and not a
government of men. It was not intended that the President
or any other official would have a right to disregard the laws
of Congress in accounting on government activity. The President,
it should be pointed out, has all of the protection he
needs to prevent Congress from unduly interfering with him
in carrying out his executive responsibilities. The separation
of powers of the three branches of government is clearly set
out in the Constitution, and the only way the Constitution
has provided for Congress to take action against the President
is to impeach him. Since no President yet has been
impeached, this procedure would be resorted to in only the
most drastic of circumstances.</p>

<p>The President of the United States, with the vast power
and prestige of his office, has the obligation to set a tone
of government that assures the fullest possible flow of information
consistent with the nation’s security. He must take
the lead in breaking down the arrogance of the bureaucracy
that assumes a right to keep the knowledge of the people’s
business from the people themselves, and thus restore the
people’s faith in their governmental servants.</p>

<p>President Kennedy has made an uncertain start. Whether
he succeeds depends not only on him, but on the press and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span>
the public as well. We cannot afford to allow our faith in
a President’s good intentions and his own personal integrity
to blind us, as we did during President Eisenhower’s administration,
to the machinations of the Washington cover-up.
The press, the Congress, the public must make certain that
Attorney General Kennedy and other key members of the
Kennedy administration remember how “terribly important”
it is that Congress and the Government Accounting Office
maintain full access to the records of government.</p>

<p>When the old secrecy practices are cast aside and the
freedom of information guaranteed, then will our democracy
flourish as the founding fathers intended it should.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="allsmcap">THE WHITE HOUSE</span>,<br>
<em>May 17, 1954</em></p>
<p class="no-indent">
The Honorable the <span class="smcap">Secretary of Defense</span>,<br>
<em>Washington, D. C.</em><br>
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Secretary</span>: It has long been recognized that to assist the
Congress in achieving its legislative purposes every Executive Department
or Agency must, upon the request of a Congressional Committee,
expeditiously furnish information relating to any matter within the
jurisdiction of the Committee, with certain historical exceptions—some
of which are pointed out in the attached memorandum from the
Attorney General. This Administration has been and will continue to
be diligent in following this principle. However, it is essential to the
successful working of our system that the persons entrusted with
power in any one of the three great branches of Government shall not
encroach upon the authority confided to the others. The ultimate responsibility
for the conduct of the Executive branch rests with the
President.</p>

<p>Within this Constitutional framework each branch should co-operate
fully with each other for the common good. However, throughout
our history the President has withheld information whenever he found
that what was sought was confidential or its disclosure would be
incompatible with the public interest or jeopardize the safety of the
Nation.</p>

<p>Because it is essential to efficient and effective administration that
employees of the Executive Branch be in a position to be completely
candid in advising with each other on official matters, and because it is
not in the public interest that any of their conversations or communications,
or any documents or reproductions, concerning such advice be
disclosed, you will instruct employees of your Department that in all
of their appearances before the Subcommittee of the Senate Committee
on Government Operations regarding the inquiry now before it they
are not to testify to any such conversations or communications or to
produce any such documents or reproductions. This principle must be
maintained regardless of who would be benefited by such disclosures.</p>

<p>I direct this action so as to maintain the proper separation of powers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span>
between the Executive and Legislative Branches of the Government in
accordance with my responsibilities and duties under the Constitution.
This separation is vital to preclude the exercise of arbitrary power by
any branch of the Government.</p>

<p>By this action I am not in any way restricting the testimony of such
witnesses as to what occurred regarding any matters where the communication
was directly between any of the principals in the controversy
within the Executive Branch on the one hand and a member of
the Subcommittee or its staff on the other.</p>

<p class="right">

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="no-indent">
For: the President.<br>
From: the Attorney General.<br>
</p>

<p>One of the chief merits of the American system of written constitutional
law is that all the powers entrusted to the government are
divided into three great departments, the Executive, the Legislative,
and the Judicial. It is essential to the successful working of this system
that the persons entrusted with power in any one of these branches
shall not be permitted to encroach upon the powers confided to the
others, but that each shall be limited to the exercise of the powers
appropriate to its own department and no other. The doctrine of
separation of powers was adopted to preclude the exercise of arbitrary
power and to save the people from autocracy.</p>

<p>This fundamental principle was fully recognized by our first President,
George Washington, as early as 1796 when he said: “... it is
essential to the due administration of the Government that the boundaries
fixed by the Constitution between the different departments
should be preserved....” In his Farewell Address, President Washington
again cautioned strongly against the danger of encroachment
by one department into the domain of another as leading to despotism.
This principle has received steadfast adherence throughout the many
years of our history and growth. More than ever, it is our duty today
to heed these words if our country is to retain its place as a leader
among the free nations of the world.</p>

<p>For over 150 years—almost from the time that the American form
of government was created by the adoption of the Constitution—our
Presidents have established, by precedent, that they and members of
their Cabinet and other heads of executive departments have an undoubted
privilege and discretion to keep confidential, in the public
interest, papers and information which require secrecy. American history
abounds in countless illustrations of the refusal, on occasion, by
the President and heads of departments to furnish papers to Congress,
or its committees, for reasons of public policy. The messages of our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span>
past Presidents reveal that almost every one of them found it necessary
to inform Congress of his constitutional duty to execute the office of
President, and, in furtherance of that duty, to withhold information
and papers for the public good.</p>

<p>Nor are the instances lacking where the aid of a court was sought in
vain to obtain information or papers from a President and the heads
of departments. Courts have uniformly held that the President and the
heads of departments have an uncontrolled discretion to withhold the
information and papers in the public interest, they will not interfere
with the exercise of that discretion, and that Congress has not the
power, as one of the three great branches of the Government, to
subject the Executive Branch to its will any more than the Executive
Branch may impose its unrestrained will upon the Congress.</p>
</div>
<br>

<p class="center no-indent">PRESIDENT WASHINGTON’S ADMINISTRATION</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In March 1792, the House of Representatives passed the following
resolution:</p>

<p>“<em>Resolved</em>, That a committee be appointed to inquire into the causes
of the failure of the late expedition under Major General St. Clair, and
that the said committee be empowered to call for such persons, papers,
and records, as may be necessary to assist their inquiries” (3 Annals
of Congress, p. 493).</p>

<p>This was the first time that a committee of Congress was appointed
to look into a matter which involved the Executive Branch of the
Government. The expedition of General St. Clair was under the direction
of the Secretary of War. The expenditures connected therewith
came under the Secretary of the Treasury. The House based its right
to investigate on its control of the expenditures of public moneys. It
appears that the Secretaries of War and the Treasury appeared before
the committee. However, when the committee was bold enough to ask
the President for the papers pertaining to the General St. Clair campaign,
President Washington called a meeting of his Cabinet (Binkley,
<em>President and Congress</em>, pp. 40-41).</p>

<p>Thomas Jefferson, as Secretary of State, reports what took place at
that meeting. Besides Jefferson, Alexander Hamilton, Henry Knox,
Secretary of War, and Edmond Randolph, the Attorney General, were
present. The Committee had first written to Knox for the original
letters, instructions, etc., to General St. Clair. President Washington
stated that he had called his Cabinet members together, because it
was the first example of a demand on the Executive for papers, and he
wished that so far as it should become a precedent, it should be
rightly conducted. The President readily admitted that he did not
doubt the propriety of what the House was doing, but he could conceive
that there might be papers of so secret a nature that they ought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span>
not to be given up. Washington and his Cabinet came to the unanimous
conclusion:</p>

<p>“First, that the House was an inquest, and therefore might institute
inquiries. Second, that it might call for papers generally. Third, that
the Executive ought to communicate such papers as the public good
would permit, and ought to refuse those, the disclosure of which
would injure the public; consequently were to exercise a discretion.
Fourth, that neither the committee nor House had a right to call on
the Head of a Department, who and whose papers were under the
President alone; but that the committee should instruct their chairman
to move the House to address the President.”</p>

<p>The precedent thus set by our first President and his Cabinet was
followed in 1796, when President Washington was presented with a
resolution of the House of Representatives which requested him to lay
before the House a copy of the instructions to the Minister of the
United States who negotiated the treaty with the King of Great Britain,
together with the correspondence and documents relative to that
treaty. Apparently it was necessary to implement the treaty with an
appropriation which the House was called upon to vote. The House
insisted on its right to the papers requested, as a condition to appropriating
the required funds (<em>President and Congress</em>, Wilfred E. Binkley
[1947], p. 44).</p>

<p>President Washington’s classic reply was, in part, as follows:</p>

<p>“I trust that no part of my conduct has ever indicated a disposition
to withhold any information which the Constitution has enjoined upon
the President as a duty to give, or which could be required of him by
either House of Congress as a right; and with truth I affirm that it has
been, as it will continue to be while I have the honor to preside in the
Government, my constant endeavor to harmonize with the other
branches thereof so far as the trust delegated to me by the people of
the United States and my sense of the obligation it imposes to ‘preserve,
protect, and defend the Constitution’ will permit” (Richardson, <em>Messages
and Papers of the Presidents</em>, vol. 1, p. 194).</p>

<p>Washington then went on to discuss the secrecy required in negotiations
with foreign governments, and cited that as a reason for vesting
the power of making treaties in the President, with the advice and
consent of the Senate. He felt that to admit the House of Representatives
into the treaty-making power, by reason of its constitutional duty
to appropriate monies to carry out a treaty, would be to establish a
dangerous precedent. He closed his message to the House as follows:</p>

<p>“As, therefore, it is perfectly clear to my understanding that the
assent of the House of Representatives is not necessary to the validity of
a treaty; ... and as it is essential to the due administration of the
Government that the boundaries fixed by the Constitution between the
different departments should be preserved, a just regard to the Constitution<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span>
and to the duty of my office, under all the circumstances of
this case, forbids a compliance with your request” (Richardson, <em>Messages
and Papers of the Presidents</em>, vol. 1, p. 196).</p>

<p class="center no-indent">PRESIDENT JEFFERSON’S ADMINISTRATION</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In January 1807, Representative Randolph introduced a resolution,
as follows:</p>

<p>“<em>Resolved</em>, That the President of the United States be, and he hereby
is, requested to lay before this House any information in possession of
the Executive, except such as he may deem the public welfare to
require not to be disclosed, touching any illegal combination of private
individuals against the peace and safety of the Union, or any military
expedition planned by such individuals against the territories of any
Power in amity with the United States; together with the measures
which the Executive has pursued and proposes to take for suppressing
or defeating the same” (16 Annals of Congress [1806-1807], p. 336).</p>

<p>The resolution was overwhelmingly passed. The Burr conspiracy
was then stirring the country. Jefferson had made it the object of a
special message to Congress wherein he referred to a military expedition
headed by Burr. Jefferson’s reply to the resolution was a
Message to the Senate and House of Representatives. Jefferson brought
the Congress up to date on the news which he had been receiving
concerning the illegal combination of private individuals against the
peace and safety of the Union. He pointed out that he had recently
received a mass of data, most of which had been obtained without
the sanction of an oath so as to constitute formal and legal evidence.
“It is chiefly in the form of letters, often containing such a mixture of
rumors, conjectures, and suspicions as renders it difficult to sift out the
real facts and unadvisable to hazard more than general outlines,
strengthened by concurrent information or the particular credibility of
the relator. In this state of the evidence, delivered sometimes, too,
under the restriction of private confidence, neither safety nor justice
will permit the exposing names, except that of the principal actor,
whose guilt is placed beyond question” (Richardson, <em>Messages and
Papers of the Presidents</em>, vol. 1, p. 412, dated January 22, 1807).</p>
</div>
<br>

<p class="center no-indent">SIMILAR ACTIONS BY PRESIDENTS JACKSON, TYLER, BUCHANAN,
AND GRANT</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>On February 10, 1835, President Jackson sent a message to the
Senate wherein he declined to comply with the Senate’s resolution requesting
him to communicate copies of charges which had been made
to the President against the official conduct of Gideon Fitz, late<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span>
Surveyor-General, which caused his removal from office. The resolution
stated that the information requested was necessary both in the
action which it proposed to take on the nomination of a successor to
Fitz, and in connection with the investigation which was then in
progress by the Senate respecting the frauds in the sales of public lands.</p>

<p>The President declined to furnish the information. He stated that in
his judgment the information related to subjects exclusively belonging
to the executive department. The request therefore encroached on the
constitutional powers of the executive.</p>

<p>The President’s message referred to many previous similar requests,
which he deemed unconstitutional demands by the Senate:</p>

<p>“Their continued repetition imposes on me, as the representative and
trustee of the American people, the painful but imperious duty of
resisting to the utmost any further encroachment on the rights of the
Executive” (ibid., p. 133).</p>

<p>The President next took up the fact that the Senate resolution had
been passed in executive session, from which he was bound to presume
that if the information requested by the resolution were communicated,
it would be applied in secret session to the investigation of frauds in the
sales of public lands. The President said that, if he were to furnish the
information, the citizen whose conduct the Senate sought to impeach
would lose one of his basic rights, namely—that of a public investigation
in the presence of his accusers and of the witnesses against him.
In addition, compliance with the resolution would subject the motives
of the President, in the case of Mr. Fitz, to the review of the Senate
when not sitting as judges on an impeachment; and even if such a consequence
did not follow in the present case, the President feared that
compliance by the Executive might thereafter be quoted as a precedent
for similar and repeated applications.</p>

<p>“Such a result, if acquiesced in, would ultimately subject the
independent constitutional action of the Executive in a matter of
great national concernment to the domination and control of the
Senate;...</p>

<p>“I therefore decline a compliance with so much of the resolution of
the Senate as requests ‘copies of the charges, if any,’ in relation to Mr.
Fitz, and in doing so must be distinctly understood as neither affirming
nor denying that any such charges were made ...” (ibid., p.
134).</p>

<p>One of the best reasoned precedents of a President’s refusal to permit
the head of a department to disclose confidential information to the
House of Representatives is President Tyler’s refusal to communicate to
the House of Representatives the reports relative to the affairs of the
Cherokee Indians and to the frauds which were alleged to have been
practiced upon them. A resolution of the House of Representatives
had called upon the Secretary of War to communicate to the House<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span>
the reports made to the Department of War by Lieutenant Colonel
Hitchcock relative to the affairs of the Cherokee Indians together with
all information communicated by him concerning the frauds he was
charged to investigate; also all facts in the possession of the Executive
relating to the subject. The Secretary of War consulted with the President
and under the latter’s direction informed the House that negotiations
were then pending with the Indians for settlement of their claims;
in the opinion of the President and the Department, therefore, publication
of the report at that time would be inconsistent with the public
interest. The Secretary of War further stated in his answer to the
resolution that the report sought by the House, dealing with alleged
frauds which Lieutenant Colonel Hitchcock was charged to investigate,
contained information which was obtained by Colonel Hitchcock by
ex parte inquiries of persons whose statements were without the sanction
of an oath, and which the persons implicated had had no opportunity
to contradict or explain. The Secretary of War expressed the
opinion that to promulgate those statements at that time would be
grossly unjust to those persons, and would defeat the object of the
inquiry. He also remarked that the Department had not been given at
that time sufficient opportunity to pursue the investigation, to call
the parties affected for explanations, or to determine on the measures
proper to be taken.</p>

<p>The answer of the Secretary of War was not satisfactory to the
Committee on Indian Affairs of the House, which claimed the right
to demand from the Executive and heads of departments such information
as may be in their possession relating to subjects of the deliberations
of the House.</p>

<p>President Tyler in a message dated January 31, 1843, vigorously
asserted that the House of Representatives could not exercise a right
to call upon the Executive for information, even though it related to a
subject of the deliberations of the House, if, by so doing, it attempted
to interfere with the discretion of the Executive.</p>

<p>The same course of action was taken by President James Buchanan
in 1860 in resisting a resolution of the House to investigate whether
the President or any other officer of the Government had, by money,
patronage, or other improper means sought to influence the action of
Congress for or against the passage of any law relating to the rights of
any state or territory. (See Richardson, <em>Messages and Papers of the
Presidents</em>, vol. 5, pp. 618-19.)</p>

<p>In the administration of President Ulysses S. Grant the House requested
the President to inform it whether any executive offices, acts,
or duties, and if any, what, have been performed at a distance from
the seat of government established by law. It appears that the purpose
of this inquiry was to embarrass the President by reason of his having
spent some of the hot months at Long Branch. President Grant replied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span>
that he failed to find in the Constitution the authority given to the
House of Representatives, and that the inquiry had nothing to do with
legislation (Richardson, <em>Messages and Papers of the Presidents</em>,
vol. 7, pp. 362-63).</p>
</div>
<br>

<p class="center no-indent">PRESIDENT CLEVELAND’S ADMINISTRATION</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In 1886, during President Cleveland’s administration, there was an
extended discussion in the Senate with reference to its relations to the
Executive caused by the refusal of the Attorney General to transmit to
the Senate certain documents concerning the administration of the
Office of the District Attorney for the Southern District of South
Alabama, and suspension of George W. Durkin, the late incumbent.
The majority of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary concluded that
it was entitled to know all that officially exists or takes place in any
of the departments of Government and that neither the President nor
the head of a department could withhold official facts and information
as distinguished from private and unofficial papers.</p>

<p>In his reply President Cleveland disclaimed any intention to withhold
official papers, but he denied that papers and documents inherently
private or confidential, addressed to the President or a head of a
department, having reference to an act entirely executive such as the
suspension of an official, were changed in their nature and became
official when placed for convenience in the custody of a public department.
(Richardson, <em>Messages and Papers of the Presidents</em>, vol. 8,
pp. 378-79, 381.)</p>

<p>Challenging the attitude that because the executive departments
were created by Congress the latter had any supervisory power over
them, President Cleveland declared (Eberling, <em>Congressional Investigation</em>,
p. 258):</p>

<p>“I do not suppose that the public offices of the United States are
regulated or controlled in their relations to either House of Congress
by the fact that they were created by laws enacted by themselves. It
must be that these instrumentalities were created for the benefit of
the people and to answer the general purposes of government under
the Constitution and the laws, and that they are unencumbered by
any lien in favor of either branch of Congress growing out of their
construction, and unembarrassed by any obligation to the Senate as
the price of their creation.”</p>
</div>
<br>

<p class="center no-indent">PRESIDENT THEODORE ROOSEVELT’S ADMINISTRATION</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In 1909, during the administration of President Theodore Roosevelt,
the question of the right of the President to exercise complete direction
and control over heads of executive departments was raised again.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span>
At that time the Senate passed a resolution directing the Attorney
General to inform the Senate whether certain legal proceedings had
been instituted against the United States Steel Corporation, and if not,
the reasons for its nonaction. Request was also made for any opinion
of the Attorney General, if one was written. President Theodore Roosevelt
replied refusing to honor this request upon the ground that “Heads
of the Executive Departments are subject to the Constitution, and to
the laws passed by the Congress in pursuance of the Constitution, and
to the directions of the President of the United States, but to no other
direction whatever” (<cite>Congressional Record</cite>, vol. 43, pt. 1, 60th Cong.,
2d sess., pp. 527-28).</p>

<p>When the Senate was unable to get the documents from the Attorney
General, it summoned Herbert K. Smith, the Head of the Bureau
of Corporations, and requested the papers and documents on penalty
of imprisonment for contempt. Mr. Smith reported the request to the
President, who directed him to turn over to the President all the
papers in the case “so that I could assist the Senate in the prosecution
of its investigation.” President Roosevelt then informed Senator Clark
of the Judiciary Committee what had been done, that he had the
papers and the only way the Senate could get them was through his
impeachment. President Roosevelt also explained that some of the
facts were given to the Government under the seal of secrecy and
cannot be divulged, “and I will see to it that the word of this Government
to the individual is kept sacred.” (Corwin, <cite>The President: Office
and Powers</cite>, pp. 281, 428; Abbott, <cite>The Letters of Archie Butt, Personal
Aid to President Roosevelt</cite>, pp. 305-6.)</p>
</div>
<br>

<p class="center no-indent">PRESIDENT COOLIDGE’S ADMINISTRATION</p>

<p>In 1924, during the administration of President Coolidge, the latter
objected to the action of a special investigating committee appointed
by the Senate to investigate the Bureau of Internal Revenue. Request
was made by the committee for a list of the companies in which the
Secretary of the Treasury was alleged to be interested for the purpose
of investigating their tax returns. Calling this exercise of power an unwarranted
intrusion, President Coolidge said:</p>

<p>“Whatever may be necessary for the information of the Senate or
any of its committees in order to better enable them to perform
their legislative or other constitutional functions ought always to be
furnished willingly and expeditiously by any department. But it is recognized
both by law and custom that there is certain confidential information
which it would be detrimental to the public service to reveal”
(68th Cong., 1st sess., <cite>Record</cite>, April 11, 1924, p. 6087).</p>

<p class="center no-indent">PRESIDENT HOOVER’S ADMINISTRATION</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A similar question arose in 1930 during the administration of President
Hoover. Secretary of State Stimson refused to disclose to the
Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee certain confidential
telegrams and letters leading up to the London Conference and the
London Treaty. The Committee asserted its right to have full and free
access to all records touching the negotiations of the treaty, basing
its right on the constitutional prerogative of the Senate in the treaty-making
process. In his message to the Senate, President Hoover pointed
out that there were a great many informal statements and reports
which were given to the Government in confidence. The Executive was
under a duty, in order to maintain amicable relations with other
nations, not to publicize all the negotiations and statements which
went into the making of the treaty. He further declared that the
Executive must not be guilty of a breach of trust, nor violate the
invariable practice of nations. “In view of this, I believe that to further
comply with the above resolution would be incompatible with the
public interest” (S. Doc. No. 216, 71st Cong., special sess., p. 2).</p>

<p class="center no-indent">PRESIDENT FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT’S ADMINISTRATION</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The position was followed during the administration of President
Franklin D. Roosevelt. There were many instances in which the President
and his Executive heads refused to make available certain information
to Congress the disclosure of which was deemed to be confidential
or contrary to the public interest. Merely a few need be cited.</p>

<p>1. Federal Bureau of Investigation records and reports were refused
to congressional committees, in the public interest (40 Op. A. G. No. 8,
April 30, 1941).</p>

<p>2. The Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation refused to
give testimony or to exhibit a copy of the President’s directive requiring
him, in the interests of national security, to refrain from testifying
or from disclosing the contents of the Bureau’s reports and activities.
(<cite>Hearings</cite>, vol. 2, House, 78th Cong. Select Committee to Investigate
the Federal Communications Commission, 1944, p. 2337.)</p>

<p>3. Communications between the President and the heads of departments
were held to be confidential and privileged and not subject to
inquiry by a committee of one of the Houses of Congress. (Letter
dated January 22, 1944, signed Francis Biddle, Attorney General to
Select Committee, etc.)</p>

<p>4. The Director of the Bureau of the Budget refused to testify and
to produce the Bureau’s files, pursuant to subpoena which had been
served upon him, because the President had instructed him not to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span>
make public the records of the Bureau due to their confidential nature.
Public interest was again invoked to prevent disclosure. (Reliance
placed on Attorney General’s Opinion in 40 Op. A. G. No. 8, April
30, 1941.)</p>

<p>5. The Secretaries of War and Navy were directed not to deliver
documents which the committee had requested, on grounds of public
interest. The Secretaries, in their own judgment, refused permission to
Army and Navy officers to appear and testify because they felt that it
would be contrary to the public interests. (<cite>Hearings</cite>, Select Committee

<p>During the Truman administration also the President adhered to

<p>Thus, you can see that the Presidents of the United States have
withheld information of Executive departments or agencies whenever
it was found that the information sought was confidential or that its
disclosure would be incompatible with the public interest or jeopardize
the safety of the Nation. The courts too have held that the question
whether the production of the papers was contrary to the public interest
was a matter for the Executive to determine.</p>

<p>By keeping the lines which separate and divide the three great
branches of our Government clearly defined, no one branch has been
able to encroach upon the powers of the other.</p>

<p>Upon this firm principle our country’s strength, liberty, and democratic
form of government will continue to endure.</p>

</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Mr. President</span>: At your press conference on Thursday, September
27, 1956, you were asked whether your letter of May 17, 1954,
to Secretary of Defense Charles E. Wilson was being misused as
authority to restrict information from the public.</p>

<p>This question was posed by Mr. Clark Mollenhoff of the Des Moines
Register and Tribune.</p>

<p>You stated that if Mr. Mollenhoff would put the question in writing—which
I understand he has done—it will be answered.</p>

<p>This particular letter and its misuse by a number of Federal departments
and agencies has been a great concern to the Special Subcommittee
on Government Information. Although the letter, and the
accompanying memorandum from the Attorney General, granted
authority to one particular agency to refuse information to a specific
committee of Congress in a single instance, 19 departments and agencies
have cited the letter as authority to refuse information to the
public or the Congress.</p>

<p>This occurred in agency answers to the subcommittee’s questionnaire
of November 7, 1955, on information practices and policies as well as
during subcommittee hearings with executive officials.</p>

<p>Enclosed is an intermediate report, adopted unanimously by the
House Government Operations Committee, on the subcommittee’s
study of restrictions on information. The problem of misuse of the
May 17, 1954, letter is discussed on page 90 and at other points.</p>

<p>When the answer to Mr. Mollenhoff’s question has been prepared
and transmitted to him, the subcommittee would appreciate receiving
copies of it and any other comments you have on the matter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Clark</span>: At the press conference on September 27, 1956, you
asked the President whether “all employees of the Federal Government,
at their own discretion, can determine whether they will testify
or will not testify before congressional committees when there is no
security problem involved.”</p>

<p>In the President’s letter of May 17, 1954, to Secretary Wilson, the
President set forth the general principles that are to govern all employees
in the executive branch concerning their testimony, or the production
of documents, relating to their conversations or communications
with, or their advice to, each other on official matters. In his press
conference of July 6, 1955, the President further amplified the principles
set forth in this letter as follows:</p>

<p>“If anybody in an official position of this Government does anything
which is an official act, and submits it either in the form of recommendation
or anything else, that is properly a matter for investigation if
Congress so chooses, provided the national security is not involved.</p>

<p>“But when it comes to the conversations that take place between
any responsible official and his advisers, or exchange of mere little
slips, of this or that, expressing personal opinions on the most confidential
basis, those are not subject to investigation by anybody. And
if they are it will wreck the Government.”</p>

<p>In so writing to Secretary Wilson, and in further amplifying these
principles, the President was exercising a right, which is his, and his
alone, to determine what action is necessary to maintain the proper
separation of powers between the executive and legislative branches
of the Government. In the orderly administration of the Government,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span>
the head of each executive agency directs the manner in which these
principles are enforced.</p>

<p>The underlying reasons for these principles are set forth in the
President’s letter of May 17, 1954. It is essential to efficient and effective
administration that employees of the executive branch be in a
position to be completely candid in advising each other on official
matters. It is essential, if channels of information are to be kept open,
that confidences among employees should not be breached.</p>

<p>It will continue to be this administration’s policy to keep the Congress
and the people fully informed of what is being done in the
executive branch. An employee is not free merely to exercise his own
discretion but in the final analysis information will be withheld only
when the President or agency heads acting under the President’s
authority or instruction determine it is contrary to the public interest
to disclose it.</p>

<p>All of the above, of course, is subject to the Executive order dealing
with the classification of information in the interest of security, and
to the various statutes and regulations of the department and agencies
relating to information to be held in confidence.</p>

<p>I hope this answers your inquiry.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Mr. President</span>: I just returned to Washington for a hearing
of the Government Information Subcommittee. The subcommittee, I
understand, will inquire into the matter of General Accounting Office
access to Air Force Inspector General’s reports. In that context, my
attention has been directed to your press conference comments of November<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span>
5, and to some newspaper speculation about those comments.</p>

<p>The text of your remarks to which I refer is as follows:</p>

<p>“Q. (Clark R. Mollenhoff, Des Moines Register). Mr. President,
you have mentioned the spending in the Defense Department here
as one of the important issues, and the General Accounting Office,
which is the watchdog on frauds and extravagance in the various
agencies, has been barred from reports over in the Air Force and the
Defense Department generally, and on this they claim that they have
authority from you to withhold reports any time it is ‘inexpedient to
do so.’</p>

<p>“I wonder if you have given that authority and if you feel that the
GAO should have a full rein to go in and investigate all indications of
fraud and extravagance.</p>

<p>“The <span class="smcap">President</span>. You are obviously talking about some special thing
that I would have to study before I could make—give an answer.</p>

<p>“I have stated this time and again: I believe that every investigating
committee of the Congress, every auditing office, like the GAO, should
always have an opportunity to see official records if the security of our
country is not involved.</p>

<p>“Q. (Clark R. Mollenhoff, Des Moines Register). Well, they claim
this, Mr. President, under executive privilege.</p>

<p>“The <span class="smcap">President</span>. No, that’s all I have to say—I told you that is all I
had to say for the moment.”</p>

<p>While this question-and-answer exchange did not identify Inspector
General reports, and while you did preface your comment by saying
this obviously referred to some special thing you would have to study
before giving an answer, I would nevertheless like to ask this: Did you
mean to imply by your comments that the complete text of Inspector
General reports, including recommendations, be made available to
Congress and the General Accounting Office?</p>

<p>I believe, of course, that the public, the Congress, and such auditing
units as the General Accounting Office should have all the information
departments and agencies can properly make available. However, the
public interest also demands order and efficiency in the operation of
these departments and agencies. And in my judgment the public
interest is not necessarily served by divulging the advice, suggestions, or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span>
recommendations which subordinate employees periodically make to
their superiors. In this connection, recommendations of inspectors general
have been a most useful advisory tool in administering the military
departments; and historically, recommendations and other advisory
matter in such reports have not been released. I think this practice is a
correct one, and is in the best interest of the Nation. At the same
time, I want to add that the facts are distinct from advice and recommendations
in these reports. It is my understanding that all the facts
developed in the inspector general’s report to which you refer are being
made available at the request of the General Accounting Office.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 2em; text-indent: -2em;"><span class="smcap">Memorandum on Right of the Comptroller General to Access
to a Report of the Inspector General of the Air Force Entitled
“Survey of Management of the Ballistic Missiles
Program”</span></p>
</div>

<p>The basic statutory authority of the Comptroller General for access
to records of departments and agencies is set forth in section 313 of
the Budget and Accounting Act, 1921 (31 U.S.C. 54). Section 313
provides:</p>

<p>“<em>All departments and establishments shall furnish to the Comptroller
General such information</em> regarding the powers, duties, activities, organization,
financial transactions, and methods of business of their
respective offices <em>as he may</em> from time to time <em>require of them</em>; and
the Comptroller General, or any of his assistants or employees, when
duly authorized by him, shall, for the purpose of securing such information,
have access to and the right to examine <em>any</em> books, documents,
papers, or records of <em>any</em> such department or establishment. The
authority contained in this section shall not be applicable to expenditures
made under the provisions of section 291 of the Revised
Statutes.”</p>

<p>It will be noted that the only exception in section 313 relates to
expenditures made under section 291, Revised Statutes (31 U.S.C.
107), which authorizes the Secretary of State to account for certain
confidential expenditures in connection with intercourse or treaties with
foreign nations by certificate where, in his judgment, he may think it
advisable not to specify the details of such expenditure. Since that is
the only exception stated and following the legal maxim that the
specific setting forth of one type of exception precludes others from
arising, it seems clear that the Comptroller General may require, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span>
the departments are required to furnish, documents, etc., as to any
other transaction or activity. Also, the language of section 313 itself
[except as to the expenditures under 291 R. S.] in requiring the
departments to furnish such information as the Comptroller General
“may require of them” and its requirement that he be <em>given access to
any</em> documents of the departments, clearly gives him access to <em>all</em>
such documentation. If he has access to <em>any</em> document, he has access
to <em>all</em>. The legislative background of the Budget and Accounting Act,
1921, makes no qualification as to what records can be required; the
provision itself apparently being considered sufficiently specific. The
legislative reports do bring out that one of the principal functions of
the Comptroller General is to enable the Congress to be kept advised
as to expenditures of the Government, and that the Comptroller General
is expected to criticize extravagance, duplication, and inefficiency
in executive departments. There is no doubt, in passing the act, the
Congress did not intend that the executive agencies could, or would,
withhold any books, documents, papers, or records needed by the
Comptroller General. Otherwise, the very purpose of the act would be
nullified.</p>

<p>The authority and duty of the Comptroller General was amplified by
section 206 of the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946 (31 U.S.C.
60), which authorized and directed him to make expenditure analyses
of each agency in the executive branch of the Government which “will
enable Congress to determine whether public funds have been economically
and efficiently administered and expended” and to make reports
thereon from time to time to the Committees on Government Operations,
and Appropriations and other committees having jurisdiction
over legislation relating to the operation of the agencies involved. The
work of the Comptroller General, together with the activities of the
Committees on Government Operations, were to serve as a check on
the economy and efficiency of administrative management. See pages
6 and 7, Senate Report No. 1400 on the Legislative Reorganization
Act of 1946.</p>

<p>The Congress has also directed that the Comptroller General in
performing his duties give full consideration to the administrative
reports and controls of the departments and agencies. The Government
Corporation Control Act specifically provides in section 301 (a)
(31 U.S.C. 866), “That in making the audits ... the Comptroller
General shall, to the fullest extent deemed by him to be practicable,
utilize reports of examination of Government corporations made by a
supervising administrative agency pursuant to law.” The legislative
reports on that act, Senate Report 694, page 10, contains the following
significant language:</p>

<p>“The audit provisions are intended to give the Congress the independent
audit reports of its agent, the Comptroller General, as to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span>
operations and financial condition of every Government corporation in
which the Government has a capital interest.... If the audit by the
Comptroller General is to be a truly independent audit, he must not be
restricted in such a way as to prevent him from examining into and
reporting the transactions of any Government corporation to the extent
deemed by him to be necessary.</p>

<p>“The Comptroller General has stated that in making his audits he
will give full consideration to the effectiveness of the existing systems
of internal accounts, procedures, and controls and of external examinations
by an administrative supervisory agency. The bill includes a
specific provision requiring the Comptroller General in making his
audits to utilize, to the fullest extent deemed by him to be practicable,
reports of examinations of Government corporations by a supervising
administrative agency pursuant to law.”</p>

<p>The Budget and Accounting Procedures Act of 1950 requires each
executive agency to maintain systems of accounting and internal control
and provides, in section 117 (a) (31 U.S.C. 67 [a]), that the
Comptroller General in determining auditing procedures and the extent
of examination to be given accounts and vouchers give consideration
to “the effectiveness of accounting organizations and systems, internal
audit and control, and related administrative practices of the respective
agencies.”</p>

<p>The Comptroller General is required to audit the activities of the
executive departments and agencies; to make expenditure analyses to
determine whether funds have economically been expended; and to
give consideration to the departments’ internal audit and control and
related administrative practices. To perform these duties he is given the
clear statutory authority to require information of the departments and
agencies regarding their organization, activities, and methods of business,
coupled with the right to access to <em>any</em> books, documents, papers,
or records of any such establishment (except as to the confidential
State Department funds).</p>

<p>There have been no court cases construing the statutes giving the
Comptroller General access to records. However, in 1925, the Attorney
General in an opinion to the Secretary of War (34 Op. Atty. Gen.
446), concerning a request by the Comptroller General for information
relative to an award of a contract showing that the lowest bid was
accepted, or if otherwise, a statement for the reasons for accepting
other than the lowest bid, advised, in part, as follows:</p>

<p>“It will be observed that the Comptroller General states that this
requirement is made necessary in order that a satisfactory audit may
be made. What papers or data he should have to make such an audit
would seem to be a matter solely for his determination. Moreover,
section 313 of the Budget and Accounting Act provides (p. 26):</p>

<p>“All departments and establishments shall furnish to the Comptroller<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span>
General such information regarding the powers, duties, activities, organization,
financial transactions, and methods of business of their
respective offices as he may from time to time require of them; and
the Comptroller General, or any of his assistants or employees, when
duly authorized by him, shall, for the purpose of securing such information,
have access to and the right to examine any books, documents,
papers, or records of any such department or establishment....”</p>

<p>Questions as to whether the General Accounting Office has a right
to access to records claimed to be confidential for security or other
reasons have arisen from time to time and the General Accounting
Office has always taken the position that it has the right to the information,
even though certain provisions of law relating to disclosure
might be applicable to it.</p>

<p>The General Accounting Office recognizes that certain of the functions
of the inspectors general, such as criminal and personnel investigations,
are of a confidential nature and it will normally accept summaries
of facts contained in such reports to the extent they are needed
in connection with its work. However, the inspectors general also
have as a part of their respective missions and duties responsibility for
conducting inspections, surveys, and examinations of the effectiveness
of operations and overall efficiency of a command, installation, or
activity. These functions may be performed on a periodic or special
basis as directed by competent authority. The performance of these
functions constitutes an important part of the process of management
evaluations and internal reviews as distinguished from criminal or
personnel investigations. They provide officials and appropriate personnel
of authority with an independent appraisal of the effectiveness of
operations and overall efficiency. Moreover, a very considerable part of
the inspections and reviews made by the inspectors general involve
reviews of procedures and policies and as such are an important segment
of the internal reviews and control which the General Accounting
Office, under section 117 (a) of the Budget and Accounting Procedures
Act of 1950 is required to consider and recognize in determining the
audit procedures to be followed in its reviews.</p>

<p>The scope of inspection and survey programs of the inspectors
general is similar in character to much of the work the General Accounting
Office has scheduled in requirements, procurement, supply management,
and research and development areas. The programs of the
Deputy Inspector General for Inspection of the Air Force covering
the period July 1, to December 31, 1958, include (1) a survey of
Air Force procurement methods (advertising versus negotiation); (2)
a survey of procurement quantitative and qualitative program changes;
(3) a survey of procurement of commercial communications and
utility services; (4) a survey of contract cost overruns; (5) a survey
of maintenance programs; (6) a survey of modification programs; (7)<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span>
a survey of the application of electronic data processing systems and
other like subjects. All of these subjects represent internal and management
evaluations which would clearly be a part of “internal audit and
control” within the meaning of section 117 (a) of the Accounting and
Auditing Act of 1950. It is essential that such reports be made available
to the General Accounting Office in order that it can evaluate
the effectiveness of the department’s system of internal control and to
preclude unwarranted and unnecessary duplication of effort in the
internal audit and the independent review made by this Office. The
Air Force Inspector General’s report on the ballistic missiles program
clearly falls within the term “internal audit and control.”</p>

<p>The Secretary of the Air Force in refusing the Comptroller General
access to the Inspector General’s report on the ballistic missiles
program stated that the Inspector General’s reports are prepared solely
for the use of responsible officials within the Air Force, and that the
objective of self-criticism can be obtained only if the Inspector General’s
organization has the assurance that its reports will, without exception,
be kept within the Department. The Secretary also stated that
the report in question concerned the internal management of the Department,
and was prepared solely for the benefit and use of those officers
and employees of the Department who are responsible for its
administration, and that the release of such reports to persons outside
the Department would have a serious effect on the effective administration
of the Department. The Secretary concluded that these considerations
compelled him to conclude that the public interest would best be
served by not releasing the report.</p>

<p>It is our understanding that the position of the Secretary is premised
on paragraph 151 (b) (3) of the Manual for Courts Martial (1951)
which was prescribed by the President on February 8, 1951, through
Executive Order 10214, pursuant to the act of May 5, 1950 (64 Stat.
107), and on the general basis that the heads of executive departments
have the right to withhold information or papers which they deem
confidential, in the public interest.</p>

<p>The Manual for Courts Martial, 1951, Executive Order 10214, dated
February 8, 1951, was issued pursuant to article 36 of the act of May
5, 1950 (64 Stat. 120). Article 36 (a) provides:</p>

<p>“The procedure, including modes of proof, in cases before courts-martial,
courts of inquiry, military commissions, and other military tribunals
may be prescribed by the President by regulations which shall,
so far as he deems practicable, apply the principles of law and the
rules of evidence generally recognized in the trial of criminal cases in
the United States district courts, but which shall not be contrary or
inconsistent with this code.”</p>

<p>Article 151 (b) (3) of the Manual for Courts Martial provides:</p>

<p>“The Inspectors General of the various armed forces, and their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span>
assistants, are confidential agents of the Secretaries of the military or
executive departments concerned, or of the military commander on
whose staff they may be serving. Their investigations are privileged
unless a different procedure is prescribed by the authority ordering
the investigation. Reports of such investigations and their accompanying
testimony and exhibits are likewise privileged, and there is no
authority of law or practice requiring that copies thereof be furnished
to any person other than the authority ordering the investigation or
superior authority. However, when application is made to the authority
by court-martial certain testimony, or an exhibit, accompanying a report
of investigation, which testimony or exhibit has become material
in a trial (to show an inconsistent statement of a witness, for example),
he should ordinarily approve such application unless the testimony or
exhibit requested contains a state secret or unless in the exercise of a
sound discretion he is of the opinion that it would be contrary to public
policy to divulge the information desired.</p>

<p>“In certain cases, it may become necessary to introduce evidence
of a highly confidential or secret nature, as when an accused is on
trial for having unlawfully communicated information of such a nature
to persons not entitled thereto. In a case of this type, the court should
take adequate precautions to insure that no greater dissemination of
such evidence occurs than the necessities of the trial require. The
courtroom should be cleared of spectators while such evidence is being
received or commented upon, and all persons whose duties require
them to remain should be warned that they are not to communicate
such confidential or secret information....”</p>

<p>Since the Manual for Courts Martial was issued pursuant to the
authority of the President to prescribe procedure for such trials, and
Article 151 (b) MCM by its language is addressed to procedures of
such courts, it obviously does not affect access by the General
Accounting Office to Inspector Generals reports determined by the
Comptroller General to be necessary to the performance of his work,
particularly where the report requested is not one dealing with personnel
or criminal investigations.</p>

<p>Air Force Regulation 120-3, paragraph 9, October 11, 1954, and
similar regulations provide:</p>

<p>“Disclosure of or access to matters pertinent to an inquiry or investigation
will be limited to persons whose official duties require such
knowledge. The Manual for Courts Martial, 1951, states that inspector-general
investigations are privileged information. The same privileged
status applies to inquiries and investigations conducted under this
Regulation. Also paragraph 3, AFR 190-16, 29 July 1954, excludes
investigative reports and reports of inspectors general and base inspectors
from release to the public as information. Reports by investigators<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span>
will not be released or disclosed outside the Air Force without approval
of the Secretary of the Air Force.”</p>

<p>Presumably these regulations were issued pursuant to section 161,
Revised Statutes, title 5, United States Code, section 22, or similar
authority, authorizing the head of a department to issue regulations,
<em>not inconsistent with law</em>, for the conduct of his department and the
custody and use of its records. Since under section 313 of the Budget
and Accounting Act the Secretary is required to give the Comptroller
General access to the records, any construction of the Air Force regulation
denying the Comptroller General access is improper, and the
regulation to that extent, being inconsistent with law, has no effect.</p>

<p>With reference to the right or privilege of the head of the “Executive”
branch of the Government to refuse to the legislative and judicial
branch of the Government free access to records in the custody of the
executive departments, support for such claim of right or privilege is
found in 25 Op. Atty. Gen. 326, 40 Op. Atty. Gen. 45, and cases referred
to therein.</p>

<p>Assuming, arguendo, that such right or privilege does exist, we do
not believe it warrants an executive agency denying to the Comptroller
General information or access to its documents in view of section 313
of the Budget and Accounting Act which clearly provides that “all
departments ... shall furnish ... information ...” required by
the Comptroller General and that he shall have “access to and
the right to examine any ... documents of any such department....”
The opinion of the Attorney General in 1925, 34 Op.
Atty. Gen. 446, discussed earlier, clearly recognizes the prerogative of
the Comptroller General to determine what papers he should have to
enable him properly to perform his audits and that the departments are
required to furnish them.</p>

<p>The right or privilege asserted from time to time by the executive
branch was considered in a study by the staff of the House Committee
on Government Operations entitled “The right of Congress to
obtain information from the Executive and from other agencies of the
Federal Government,” committee print dated May 3, 1956, and in great
detail by the House Committee on Government Operations in connection
with Public Law 85-619 approved August 12, 1958, as were
the court cases cited and relied upon by the Attorney General. See
House Report No. 1461, 85th Congress, 2d session. Also, there was
there considered a line of later decisions starting with <em>McGrain</em> v.
<em>Daugherty</em>, 273 U. S. 135 (1927) which upheld the power of Congress
to require information sought for legislative purposes. None of
the cases relied upon by the Attorney General involved demands by
the Congress for information from the executive agencies. This was
considered in a study on the matter furnished the committee by the
Attorney General. See page 2938 of the printed hearings before a subcommittee<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span>
of the House Committee on Government Operations on June
20 and 22, 1956, on “Availability of Information from Federal Departments
and Agencies” wherein after citing and quoting from numerous
court decisions he stated “None of the foregoing cases involved the
refusal by a head of department to obey a call for papers or information.
There has been no Supreme Court decision dealing squarely with
that question.”</p>

<p>As indicated, the precise question of whether the Congress has a
right to obtain information from the Executive which it refuses to furnish
because of its confidential nature has not been the subject of a
court decision. Where information sought by Congress by an executive
department has been refused, the Congress has, at times, succeeded in
bringing sufficient pressure to bear to obtain the information, or the
executive department has, upon reconsideration, relented and furnished
it. At other times the Congress has not pressed the matter—possibly
because of its feeling that the President was in such a position
that he should know whether the information should be withheld, or
that the Congress had no machinery to force his compliance—and
the information was not furnished. But, regardless of whether such
right or privilege exists, it is clear that the Congress in passing on
future appropriations and other legislation has a right to know whether
the funds appropriated are being properly and efficiently used for the
purposes it intended and that any information available in that regard
should be available to the Comptroller General.</p>

<p>In view of the above, and in the absence of any judicial determination
specifically dealing with the rights of the Comptroller General
under section 313, we do not believe that the position of the Secretary
of the Air Force that the report in question can be legally withheld
is proper.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Mr. President</span>: You have requested my advice whether,
under the Constitution and laws of the United States, you have the
authority as Chief Executive to issue the two attached directives to,
respectively, the Secretary of State and the Secretary of the Treasury,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span>
concerning the availability of mutual security program funds for the
expenses of the Office of the Inspector General and Comptroller established
under section 533A of the Mutual Security Act of 1954, as
amended.</p>

<p>In an opinion I have furnished you at your request, I have advised
you of my conclusions that: First, the view taken by the Comptroller
General in his letter of December 8, 1960, that the proviso contained
in section 533A(d) of the Mutual Security Act of 1954, as amended,
has operated to cut off the funds here in question, is erroneous. Second,
that if this view of the Comptroller General as to the meaning of the
proviso is correct, the proviso is unconstitutional. Third, that therefore,
despite the Comptroller General’s letters of December 8, 1960,
and December 13, 1960, these mutual security program funds continue
to be available as heretofore for the expenses of the Office of the Inspector
General and Comptroller. The reasons for these conclusions
are set forth at length in my opinion.</p>

<p>Your directives to the Secretaries of State and the Treasury are,
you advise me, in your judgment desirable to insure that mutual
security program funds will be available until the end of your term of
office on January 20, 1961, as heretofore for the expenses of the Office
of the Inspector General and Comptroller. Under these circumstances,
I am of the opinion that you, as Chief Executive, have the authority
to issue the directives.</p>

<p class="center no-indent">MUTUAL SECURITY PROGRAM—CUTOFF OF FUNDS FROM

<p style="margin-left: 2em; text-indent: -2em;">Section 533A(d) of the Mutual Security Act of 1954 added by section
401(h) of the Mutual Security Act of 1959 (73 Stat. 253),
which directs that the expenses of the Office of the Inspector
General and Comptroller with respect to programs under the Mutual
Security Act be charged to the appropriations made to carry out
such programs, <em>provided</em> that all documents, reports, and other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span>
materials relating to the operations and activities of that Office are
furnished upon request to the General Accounting Office, or to any
appropriate congressional committee or duly authorized subcommittee,
does not authorize the funds of the Office of the Inspector
General and Comptroller to be cut off because of the failure of the
State Department to furnish certain documents relating to that Office
to a congressional subcommittee, if the President has issued a certificate
pursuant to section 101(d) of the Mutual Security and
Related Agencies Appropriation Act, 1961 (74 Stat. 778), to the
effect that he has forbidden the production of those documents
and states his reasons for so doing. A contrary conclusion reached by
the Comptroller General is incorrect, and, therefore, funds continue
to be available as heretofore for the Office of the Inspector General
and Comptroller.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 2em; text-indent: -2em;">The proviso in section 533A(d) does not expressly authorize the funds
of the Office of the Inspector General and Comptroller to be cut
off, and such a drastic consequence should not lightly be inferred
from ambiguous statutory language. Other provisions of the Mutual
Security Act of 1959, the Mutual Security Act of 1960 (74 Stat.
134), the Mutual Security and Related Agencies Appropriation Act,
1960 (73 Stat. 717), and the Mutual Security and Related Agencies
Appropriation Act, 1961, indicate a congressional purpose not to
compel the disclosure of information concerning the mutual security
program which the President considers to be incompatible with the
security of the United States. Section 533A(d) should be read in
the light of this purpose.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 2em; text-indent: -2em;">Section 533A(d) has been suspended by section 101(d) of the Mutual
Security and Related Agencies Appropriation Act, 1961, which provides
that the failure to furnish documents, etc., to Congress or to
the Comptroller General will not result in a cutoff of appropriated
funds if the President certifies that he has prohibited the production
of the documents and states the reasons for this action.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 2em; text-indent: -2em;">A construction of the proviso to section 533A(d), requiring funds for
the Office of the Inspector General and Comptroller to be cut off for
failure to supply documents, notwithstanding the President’s certification,
must be avoided because it not only creates constitutional
doubts, but would, if correct, render the proviso unconstitutional.
Congress cannot by direct action compel the President to furnish to
it information the disclosure of which he considers contrary to the
national interest. It cannot achieve this result indirectly by placing
a condition upon the expenditure of appropriated funds.</p>

<em>Letter from President Kennedy
to the Secretary of Defense</em></h2>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">
<em>February 8, 1962</em><br>
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Secretary</span>: You have brought to my attention the fact
that the Senate’s Special Preparedness Investigating Subcommittee
intends to ask witnesses from your department to give testimony identifying
the names of individuals who made or recommended changes
in specific speeches.</p>

<p>As you know, it has been and will be the consistent policy of this
administration to co-operate fully with the committees of the Congress
with respect to the furnishing of information. In accordance with this
policy, you have made available to the subcommittee 1500 speeches
with marginal notes, hundreds of other documents and the names of
the fourteen individual speech reviewers, eleven of whom are military
officers. You have also made available the fullest possible background
information about each of these men, whose record of service and
devotion to the country is unquestioned in every case; and you have
permitted the committee staff to interview all witnesses requested and
to conduct such interviews outside the presence of any departmental
representative. Finally, you have identified the departmental source
of each suggested change, and offered to furnish in writing an explanation
of each such change, and the policy or guideline under which it
was made.</p>

<p>Your statement that these changes are your responsibility, that they
were made under your policies and guidelines and those of this administration
and that you would be willing to explain them in detail,
is both fitting and accurate, and offers to the subcommittee all the
information properly needed for purposes of its current inquiry. It is
equally clear that it would not be possible for you to maintain an
orderly department, and receive the candid advice and loyal respect
of your subordinates, if they—instead of you and your senior associates—are
to be individually answerable to the Congress as well as to you
for their internal acts and advice.</p>

<p>For these reasons, and in accordance with the precedents on
separation of powers established by my predecessors from the first to
the last, I have concluded that it would be contrary to the public<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span>
interest to make available any information which would enable the
subcommittee to identify and hold accountable any individual with
respect to any particular speech that he has reviewed. I therefore
direct you, and all personnel under the jurisdiction of your department,
not to give any testimony or produce any documents which would
disclose such information; and I am issuing parallel instructions to the
Secretary of State.</p>

<p>The principle which is at stake here cannot be automatically applied
to every request for information. Each case must be judged on its own
merits. But I do not intend to permit subordinate officials of our career
services to bear the brunt of congressional inquiry into policies which
are the responsibilities of their superiors.</p>

<em>Executive Privilege Correspondence between President
Kennedy and Congressman John E. Moss</em></h2>

February 15, 1962</p>
<p class="no-indent">
<em>The Honorable<br>
John F. Kennedy<br>
The President of the United States<br>
The White House<br>
Washington, D.C.</em><br>
<br>
Dear Mr. President:<br>
</p>

<p>In your letter of February 8, 1962 to Secretary McNamara you
directed him to refuse certain information to a Senate Subcommittee.
The concluding paragraph of your letter stated:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The principle which is at stake here cannot be automatically
applied to every request for information. Each case
must be judged on its merits.”</p>
</div>

<p>A similar letter from President Eisenhower on May 17, 1954 also
refused information to a Senate Subcommittee, setting forth the same
arguments covered in your letter. President Eisenhower did not, however,
state that future questions of availability of information to the
Congress would have to be answered as they came up.</p>

<p>I know you are aware of the result of President Eisenhower’s letter.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span>
Time after time Executive Branch employees far down the administrative
line from the President fell back on his letter of May 17, 1954
as authority to withhold information from the Congress and the public.</p>

<p>Some of the cases are well known—the Dixon-Yates matter and the
investigation of East-West trade controls, for instance—but many of the
refusals based on President Eisenhower’s letter of May 17, 1954 received
no public notice. A report of the House Committee on Government
Operations covering the five years from June, 1955 through June,
1960 lists 44 cases of Executive Branch officials refusing information
on the basis of the principles set forth in the May 17, 1954 letter.</p>

<p>I am confident that you share my belief that your letter of February
8, 1962 to Secretary McNamara should not be seized upon by Executive
Branch employees—many of them holding the same policymaking
positions of responsibility they did under the Eisenhower Administration—as
a new claim of authority to withhold information from the
Congress and the public. A Subcommittee staff study indicates that
during the year between the time you took office and February 8,
1962 the claim of an “executive privilege” to withhold government
information was not used successfully once, compared to the dozens of
times in previous years administrative employees held up “executive
privilege” as a shield against public and Congressional access to information.</p>

<p>Although your letter of February 8, 1962 stated clearly that the
principle involved could not be applied automatically to restrict information,
this warning received little public notice. Clarification of this
point would, I believe, serve to prevent the rash of restrictions on government
information which followed the May 17, 1954 letter from
President Eisenhower.</p>

Dear Mr. Chairman:<br>

the practice this Administration will follow in invoking the doctrine
of executive privilege in <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;original text: withholdng">withholding</ins> certain information from the
Congress.</p>

<p class="no-indent">As your letter indicated, my letter of February 8 to Secretary McNamara
made it perfectly clear that the directive to refuse to make
certain specific information available to a special subcommittee of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span>
Senate Armed Services Committee was limited to that specific request
and that “each case must be judged on its merits.”</p>

<p class="no-indent">As you know, this Administration has gone to great lengths to achieve
full co-operation with the Congress in making available to it all appropriate
documents, correspondence and information. That is the basic
policy of this Administration, and it will continue to be so. Executive
privilege can be invoked only by the President and will not be used
without specific Presidential approval. Your own interest in assuring
the widest public accessibility to governmental information is, of
course, well known, and I can assure you this Administration will continue
to co-operate with your subcommittee and the entire Congress
in achieving this objective.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
